Have you seen him?	Who?	William - he asked me to meet him here.
You're not okay.	I just need to lie down for awhile	Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
When you were gone last year $  where were you?	Busy	Were you in jail?
I should do this.	Do what?	This.
A soft side? Who knew?	Yeah, well, don't let it get out	So what's your excuse?
Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.	Is that right?	Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her.
What are you listening to, chicken ass?	Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.	With a face like that?  I don't want you looking at me.  You hear?
I could be gone for years.	I know.	I haven't given you much of a life.
I'm not asking you to swear to anything.	I don't want you to wait for me.	That's something you can't decide.
I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father.  From the beginning.  Everything.	Really?  God#  I wouldn't know where to start#  and yet# 	Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
You come!  You speak first!	Tell the Chief we thank him.	Chief knows.
Don't say anything.	Where are we going?	I'm coming with you.
Are you alright?	I still can't believe Eddie's gone.	I'm sorry.
Do you have coffee?	In the kitchen.	I'll make some for us.
Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you.	If I tell you, will you arrest me?	Arrest you for what?  Why would we arrest you?
Who's there?	Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.	I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney# 
I'll come with you.	There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.	I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.
Eddie, are you okay?	Yeah.  Now's not a good time.	Alright.
Don't worry about the damn phone.  I won't answer it.	Answer the phone.	No.  Tell me what you want to say.
Ready?	Keep them out of my way.	Okay.  You ready?
Let me get a shot of it.	Sit down!	This way.  Hold it this way.  Good.
Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.	Did you hurt her?	You know me# I never hurt anybody. Where's the money?
I can get you a job.	A job?	Yes, the money is good.
Robert# ?	What are you doing here?	You've got a call.
I speak English.	Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?	New York.
Got any spare change?  How 'bout a spare twenty?	Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!	Alright, how 'bout all your fuckin' money?
Mouth's clean, too.	Clean?	Don't blow your nose!
Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy.	Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.	GET OUTTA HERE NOW!!  GET IN THAT CAR AND DRIVE AWAY!!!  DO WHAT I SAY OR I'LL KILL YOU, TOO!!!
Too bad about Frank, isn't it?	Yes, it is.	I suppose you're pretty broken up about it?
I'm having a party tomorrow.	Yes, I know that sweetheart.	Are you coming to my party?
Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.	Thank you, Daddy.	I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
Oh, thank you very much.	Thank you.	Well, how's it going back there?
Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off.	Are you quite sure?	Yes, really, thank you very much.
I want to drive awhile.	I ain't tired yet.	Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
You and the other one, you're still Billy's girls. You always were his girls# 	Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be# 	You're gonna help us take him.
I got hit.  I can't believe it. I got shot.	You're done.  End of story.	I ain't gonna beg for my life. It ain't cool.
Hey, this works pretty good.	Thank you.	Want to try it again?
What do you think?	I think you better put him on ice, man.	He's gotta take that call #  if there is one.
There.	Must be billy's girl.	Come on.
I been waiting a long time for some money.	How much?	Half a million.
Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.	You stay with me# 	No way# 
That was quick.	When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.	Why?
Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down.	Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.	Yeah, but we didn't get 'em.
Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day# 	Jack, are you okay?	Sure, okay, fine, no problem#  See, there's this kid in jail #  First thing I got to do is go up and see what he knows # 
Elaine, I gotta put you on hold# 	Jack, wait# 	Just a second, that's all!
Hello.	Hi, it's me# 	Fuck you.
Three more hours# 	Where is he?	Promised I'd turn my back while he#  ah, never mind# 
Hard man to live with.	How would you know?	Hey, two days with him is enough.
Hey# 	Shut up.	What the hell's wrong?  I didn't do anything.
Yeah, I know that, but this is me and we're old friends. I haven't got the money so what are you gonna do about it?	Give it back.	Try and take it.
Who are you?	I brought the girl remember?	The girl?
I just found a picture of you.	How do I look?	Like shit.
Yeah?	Have you pulled yourself together?	# Not yet.
# Sorry, General, but we've got no choice! It'll only take a minute! Let me set up another meeting and I'll be back.	Three of us will never fit in there!	Oh, yes you will# 
Not going to open?	I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.	How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!
The cash man!	Been here long?	Don't fuck with me man or I'll blow you into tomorrow!
How's the detective business?	Business was fine.  I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.	You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.
What happened to you?	I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?	What's going on, Tom?  What happened?
Why haven't you called?  Why don't you answer your phone?	I don't know.  I'm sorry# 	You're sorry?  What was I supposed to think?
You should have.	Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.	Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through# 
I'll do this for you.  Fifteen thousand dollars.	Machine's in?	He's in.  It will be his pleasure.
Excellent.	Where are the women?	They should be here any minute.
Friend of yours?	Look, he's got nothing to do with this#  let him go# 	Can you guess what I'm going to say next?
You're a dead man.	Leave him alone.	Fuck off.
How long you been working there?	Three, four years.	What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
How old are you?	Twenty-five.	Where are your parents?
You#  you need to go to the police.	I told you I can't, not yet.	You don't have any other choice.
Hello#  ?	I'm here.	Do you think the film could have cost that much?
How#  how can you say that to me# ?	Will you let me look?	My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me#  she would have told me# 
Yes#  I remember Mary	You#  you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure# 	Yes.  I remember her.
Alright.  May I have your phone number, area code first?	No, you may not.	Okay.  Fine.
We'll figure it out.	Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.	Then we'll stay up together.
You've been up all night?	That obvious, huh?	Then you saw him, too?
Not really.	Is there something we can do?	I don't think so.  I guess this is my own war.
I gotta get out of here.	You just stay put.  You need rest.	You don't get it, he's after me# 
I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.	How did you know that?	I could tell you were sad.  I just wanted to see if you were all right.
I don't think this is a nice place for you to be.  Maybe we should go find your Mom.	She doesn't want me around	Oh# I'm sure that's not true.  I'll bet she's very worried about you.  I would be.
You stopped it didn't you?  It was probably just a regular bad dream.	Yeah# I guess.	You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  Or me.  Or us.  Remember# 
Thanks for everything, Dad.	You sure you don't want a ride to work?	It's just across the park.
Is there any way out of it?	Seems to be all around# 	What about down?
Open the door, will ya?	Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?	Open the door. We're late.
Why do they do that?	Do what?	You know.
She's gone already!  Gone already! Couldn't wait.	Yes.	That's all you got to say? "Yes".
Are we going in this?	Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.	It's pretty old.
You okay?	Yeah.	I'm sorry about what I said.
Call me.	Tonight. Let's get together.	Okay.
Strange.	Think they're alright?	Of course! I would've heard.
Love! What the fuck do you know about love?	Love! I'm made of love!	Call it what you want.
You don't want to say hi to your father?	I'm sure he's busy.	Don't you even want to ask?
The rest of the secret service?	Dead.	How many others killed?
Four# 	Jim# 	Three# 
Stop.	You'll do it?	Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone.
There goes your ride.	Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!	If you put down the gun, I promise not to drop her on the way down.
May I speak to you for a moment?	Can't it wait?	No, Mr. President.  It can't.
You know what?	What?	I miss you. And I miss her.
What's going on?	We're under attack.	Where's my family?
One.	But# 	Two#  THREE. GO!
Okay#  if you're the President, when's your wife's birthday?	Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the# .	Thank you for calling the white House# 
Forget it.  I was reading.	I was reading too.	What's the story?
Ted.	Not now, Elaine!	Ted!
Elaine.	Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.	Elaine, we have to go back.
Elaine!	Ted!	Elaine, what's going on?
Ted, we've only got ten minutes.	Not now, Elaine.	I mean until we start to burn up.
Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.	I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.	That might be the news we've been waiting for.
Are you afraid?	Not when I'm with you, Ted.	I guess you'd have to be a fool not to be afraid at a time like this.
You can't go in there!	Don't try to stop me!	But that's not a door.  The door's over there.
You've been hurt.	I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.	No, I mean your head.  Sit down.  I'll take a look at it.  I'm a nurse.
Can't you take a guess?	Well# not for another two hours.	You can't take a guess for another two hours?
Elaine!	Ted!	I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
Ted, what are you doing here?	Elaine, I've got to talk to you.	You# you shouldn't have come. I don't have time now.
Rain.	And a little ice.	And a little ice!
Ted# 	Yes?	I wanted you to know $  now $  I'm very proud.
Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much.	You promise you'll write.	Every day.
He's not here.  Why ask me?	The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.	She did, did she?  Well, she was wrong.  Excuse me, I have to change.
Kill them both.	Here?	Do it!
What's this?  What's going on?	Nothing.	Nothing?
Stop the car.	Why?	Please, I must get out here.
Okay, George $  we gotta play this real smart.	If the drug is here, we must destroy it.	No, George $  you're missing the point.  The drug is evidence.  We need to have the evidence, ya know?
Get outta there!	I can't!  Do you mind!	I'll cover you!  Get outta there!!
And how are we today?	Terrible.	Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.
I don't want you for a friend.	Why not?	Because you'll be gone soon, like the others.  Like everybody.  You'll be dead and you'll leave me alone.
Are we going to sleep now?	That's right.	Can we dream?
Did you know? Had you heard?	What?	The marriage!
Oh - excuse me!	Is her mother still lying on the floor?	No, she's fine.
What is it?	I want to go!	Where?
No! No! No!	Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?	Where?
There's a young girl to see you.	What does she want?	I don't know.
Give me one reason I can understand.	I can't write it!	Why not?
Come back tonight.	Tonight?	Alone.
I see that you're expecting.	Oh, yes.	When, may I ask?
What's that?	Oh, let's not talk about it.	Why not?
Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?	I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!	Why? What has happened?
What happened? Is it over?	I'm taking you home. You're not well.	No, no. I have to get back. I have -
Shall I answer it?	No! No, it's him!	Who?
Wait! Ask him if he'd give me some money now. Tell him if he would, that would help me finish it.	Finish what?	He knows. He knows!
Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred?	Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?	Would you? Actually, you could.
The Fire.	What time?	Common time.
Do you have me?	I think so.	Show me.
And that's it. Do you have it?	You go fast!	Do you have it?
Oh, Miss Price?	Yes, Doctor?	What exactly did he call out?
Aw come on, Miss Price!	Call me Alex.	Aw come on, Alex!
You're a very beautiful girl.	I thought you were asleep.	I was. What are you reading?
What do you dream about?	I dream of death mostly.	I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
My friend Jack was just here.	Your dead friend Jack?	Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?
Alex?	Yes?	Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
I am going to the cops. There's a full moon tonight. Jack was right. I# 	Jack is dead!	Jack is dead. Look, six people have been killed. I'm going to the police.
How are we feeling tonight?	No.	No what?
Are you cold?	Yes.	Good.
Jack.	David.	You're not having a good time are you?
Nice looking group.	Listen, at least it's warm in here.	Look at that.
Did you hear that?	I heard that.	What was it?
Shit! David, what is that?	I don't know. Come on.	Come on, where?
What's the plan?	Plan?	Let's just keep walking.
Jack?	Yeah.	Where are we going?
Nice to see you.	Get the fuck out of here, Jack.	Thanks a lot.
I'm going completely crazy.	David!	What?!
What are you doing here?	I wanted to see you.	Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.
Say, do me a favor, will you Charlie?	Yeah.	Let me have ten bucks?
We want to talk to you.	What about?	We'll discuss that in the board room.
What?	Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years?	Now wait a minute, wait a minute# 
What's this?	My apartment.	I knew I couldn't trust you. You told me you were taking me home.
Well, I thought I'd like to have a little talk with you.	I'm listening.	It's funny - now that I'm here, I don't know just how to go about it.  You see, I kind of expected to find you here alone.
What's the matter dear? What have I done now?	Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.	Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
Quiet down, please! Take it easy, folks. Everything will be all right.	But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!	Please, lady. Please be quiet. Everything will be all right.  Open up here, folks. All right, folks, please!
No.	Oh, you think I'm lying?	Yes.
What's he doing, honey? Is he getting any help?	Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.	They must have turned him down.
So you were home last night?	Yes.	What time did you get in?
Everybody in?	I guess so.	Where's Charlie?
How'd they $ 	What have you done?	I ain't done $ 
Bob. I didn't# 	Swear.	I swear $ 
Beautiful.	Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea $ 	A bad idea.
I think one of 'em's glass.	Which one, right or left?	The brown one.
The safe. Now.	Of course!  Uh, sir?	What?
How'd it go in there?	Fine. How'd it go out here?	We're gonna have to talk# 
Uncle Frank?	Yeah Jimmy?	How much of that story is true?
You shouldn't be up.	I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it.	You're sick of my company?
You and I, we've started#  something, you know?  I don't know what'll happen if you do this.	Me neither.	Let the law $ 
I don't understand.	She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.	That's#  wonderful. It's just#  I thought# 
Don't turn around.	What?	If you don't see it, it's not real# 
You get arrested again, I'll kill you.	Yes ma'am.	I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.
Oh. That's nice to know.  We're going to hang you, you know.	I figured.	Was it worth it?
Well, not exactly.	You been with a girl ever?	Hell yeah! I been with#   Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?
Really?	I hope I'm not being too forward.	Not at all.
I haven't seen you around here.	You just haven't been looking.	Would you like to see my apartment?
I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after last time# 	Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.	I don't think so.
You're really serious, aren't you?	Yes, I am.	But what about the past? Our past?
Where are you going?	I'm just leaving.	But where?
Doesn't he live here?	No, he doesn't.	Are you sure?
It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?	What exactly do you mean?	The message you left.
I'm leaving. I'm getting out.	Leaving what?	This.
Oh? And what should I say?	Just# say# no.	Just say no?
Yes? You're dressed# okay.	You didn't give them a name.	They know me.
Do you have a boyfriend?	No, not really.	Interesting.
# to the office this afternoon.	Why?	Just# say# no!
She's my# cousin.	Uh huh?	She's from# France.
Pardon me, but are you okay?	Who do you ask?	You seem# nervous.
Would you rather I not smoke?	No, I guess it's okay.	You sure?
I'm so hungry.	It's cold out, too, isn't it?	I'm so hungry.
It's almost nine, I've been so worried!  What did you see in there?	Nothing.	Nothing?
Look at this.	What?	Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you.
You look beautiful.	Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.	# What?
I think you should go.	You do?	I mean, it's your life.
Maybe he'll get back to work.	Speaking of which# 	Yeah, yeah.
That kid's the great white hope.	I could get it out of him.	You're not listening.
Who're these guys?	Where is he?	We're too late. Take a look.
Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?	Is it about my teeth?	Yes.
I haven't had fun like that since college.	I'm sorry.	Why?
Not a good time to lose one's head.	Indeed.	That's not the way to get ahead in life.
So, Scott, why don't we start with you. Why are you here?	Well, it's kind of weird.	We don't judge here.
I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when I say these words. Do you understand #  ?  Blue # 	#  bottle # 	Red # 
You	Have we met?	You mean you don't recall??
Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.	Promised? Who promised?	There, look!
You followed me.	Orders.	To kill me?
But you did suspect me.	Not for a moment.	You're playing games.
No, after you.	You don't trust me?	As far as you trust me.
What do you think's gonna go on at the guys' party?	They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies.	What do you mean?
I don't want any trouble.	Oh, come on, just a little.	I'm ready to make you another deal.
Great car.	The best.	I love that car.
Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!	Maybe it had something to do.	Shit!
This is it, lady. Last stop.	Can't I just go with you guys?	Sorry, we got men's business to do. It's no place for a lady.
I can't trust you!	C'mon, I knew it was you.	Rick, you're lying!
Guys, I think I'd rather stay here.	C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.	I just want to be alone.
You okay?	Yeah, I guess so.	Really?
Welcome, welcome, one and all.	Rick!	Oh, no!
What the hell is that?	My gift to you.	Under the table!
Who was that?	I don't know.	What's this?
Hey, what are you doing here?	Just#  Just wanted to say hello# 	So hello.
I saw it.	Saw what?	When dad died, I saw another fire# 
Anything else?	What are we going to do about this?	I'll handle it.
Hey.	How's it going?	Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.
Hi.	Hi.	We still talking?  Look, I'm sorry about the other day $ 
I'm sorry.	That's a dumb thing to say.	You're right.
Did you pull me out?	Yeah.	Did I say thanks?
'Bout written you off. How long have you been in town?	Four months.	Four months?
$  Burn them.	And old ladies?	$  Burn them.
I forgive you.	Me?	I forgive you.
I forgive you.	Why? Why can't you hate me? Hate me! Please! Help me!  Hate me! Help me! Hate me!	I forgive you.
OK asshole. You owe thirty grand. Now what are you gonna do?	I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.	Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind?
Do you have the money?	What money?	Don't bullshit me.
What do you want?	I want to speak with you.	Go away, unless you got my money.
How was it?	Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?	Nobody told me anything.
This is the group I was telling you about.	Which one is your brother?	The big one.
Your life will never be the same.	Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready.	We both lied to him.
What is this?	A gift.	For what?
No joke.  Serious.	Hope the same thing doesn't happen to me.  That's some big shoes to fill.	In time.
He wants you to come and see him.	He said that?	Yes he did.
So what's up with you?	What do you want to know?	The good stuff.
I'll be down front.  You better start putting your face on.	Y'know what?	What?
No.	Have you had one?	Never.
Fuck, what the fuck is going on $ 	What do we do?	Whoever it is isn't shooting at us# 
I apologize $ 	You saw West's body.	Of course $ 
We don't need the tapes $ 	Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?	We've found all of them.
I#  I don't know# 	What don't you know?	This is a lot of information to be getting#  I have to think $ 
How are you?	Been better.  I read about what's been happening with you#  I should have called $ 	What kind of trouble are you in?
That bad?	Would I have called you if it wasn't? If there was any other way $ 	Tell me what I can do.
We're fucked, I know $ 	They got their stories straight.	What?
You wanted to break him.	Yeah.	So did I.
So what now?	Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.	Think it'll work?
What are you doing out here?	Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?	Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
A word of advice about women $  that first hour or so after they kill their boss? Probably not the best time to hit on them.	I should probably write that down.	Yeah.
Enjoy your flight to Washington $ 	Wait $ 	What.
You both know if you do this, if you go after a Senator's son and you're wrong#  it's not just me in the hot seat anymore.	We know.	I'm giving you a chance to walk away.
I have to leave. Tonight.	Why?	This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere.
Or are you too scared?	I'll go in right now and get that eye.	Then do it.
You get the eye?	I brought it.	Let's see it.
Did you see that woman?	What did she look like?	Well, she#  uh# 
Lord, I'm sorry I# 	Please. Go. Just go.	I'll# 
People needn't worry so much. It's not my time yet. This isn't how I go.	Really.	Truly. I saw it in The Eye.
When did you ever work in an office?	There's a lot you don't know about me.	You're right.
But the real story is how I got the car. You see# 	Dad?	Son?
Tell me how it happens.	How what happens?	How I go.
I can try, Dad. If you help. Just tell me how it starts.	Like this.	Okay. Okay.
Oh. Oh.	Hello.	I wasn't expecting you.

Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?	That sounds great!	Anyone else? Alright Jeffrey, just a minute.
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.	Why not?	It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.
Well, how did it go? What happened?	Well, I've found out some things, nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.	What did you see?
Can I give you a kiss good night?	You better not, Jeffrey.	Okay, okay.
You were late.	I'm really sorry.	What am I going to do?
Great. Hey, I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things that could help your father but you might get into trouble.	Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it.	Okay, but I promise I won't mention you. Okay? I'll see him at the police station, okay? See you Friday night, if not before.

What was that all about?	Nothing, really! It's good to see you.	It's good to see you.
You want to dance?	I can't dance fast.	Really?

Nervous?	A bit.	Me, too.
Where are you goin'?  Did you tell him?	Yes.	Then what the fuck?
Shit!#  Shit! He ain't here.	What the fuck do you mean?	I mean he ain't here.
But in this day and age I believe what they do is#  necessary. I feel it is#  correct.	You believe?	Yes.
Don't do this my son.	Open it!	Have you no fear of God?
Holy shit. What'd I tell you?	Eight dollars.	That's not bad.
I swear to God. In a very quiet voice.	Like he meant it.	Yeah.
When'd he tell you?	This morning.	Where was I?
Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a walk $ 	I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.	We need a car.
Come on.	I'll see you there.	What?
Mr. Henry never gave you a test, did he?	What do you mean?	Nothing.
I think I may have found a way out of here.	You're kidding.	No. I'm not.
Future Man.	Who?	Future Man. You know. Cause he looks like he's from the future.
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.	No, I don't mind.	I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault.
What was that all about?	I can't believe you said that.	What did I say?
Way to go, Bob!	I told you they were there.	So it's my fault?
You can go first, Bob.	My brother's in jail.	What are you talking about?
What do you mean get back?	Well, obviously, we got to go back.	Bob, that makes no sense.
Come on, Bob.	I know it, man. Hang on.	Jesus Christ.
Hold on $ 	Here we go.	Wait a second $ 
Your brother was up here the other day. He said you ran away from home.	He said what?	He said you ran away from home.
You got to have fun with it. There's no point if you're not having any fun. Would you like me to be there tomorrow?	Yes.	Why?
What's the story?	Can't get it. It won't#  	What can we do?
How's the weather down there?	Mr. Henry?	Come on in!
Well, we'll see you later, Bob.	Pleasure to meet you, John.	Nice to meet you.
Sit down.	I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.	I don't exactly know what to say $  I'm sorry.
Who else knows about this?	Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right?	Show me again# 
It's nice.  Does this picture mean anything to you?  Hmm?	It's nothing. It's just a picture.	No. It's because you don't know how they died.
They loved you.  And I killed them.	How#  how can#  how can you be here and say this?	I don't want you to forgive me.
It doesn't matter. Your life is hard enough.	You're a liar.	You know I'm not.
I should kill you#  if it's true you should die#  I should kill you now!	I can't let you do that either.	Because you're afraid!
I have to go now.	Is this really happening?	I'm sorry.
You called it in?	I'm sorry.	How long? How long do I have $  
$  car keys?	$  my coat $  but we should $ 	$  what? $ 
That's crazy.	No. Not this. This is real.  And he's right there#  	Where $ 
# but you're not $  you're not sure# 	We can't wait to be sure.	I don't want to move again#  I like it here.
Jesus! $   $  is he back there? $ 	$  not yet $ 	$  it's just him? $ 
I wanted to kill him.	But you found another choice.	I did.
I know it's a dream.	You do?	I only dream about people who are dead.
How do they know that? How can they know any of that?	What is this, a game?	I want to hear it from you.
Okay, how do you want to do it?	I want someone I know to take me in.	Who?
Show me.	Here?	Now. Show now.
$  who? $  who else is here? $ 	$  no! $  not me! $  no other people! $ 	$  shut up! $  just shut the $ 
I don't think we need to keep looking for him anyway.	And why is that?	Because he's doing just what he said he'd do. He's coming for us.
They're coming!	How many?	Three, maybe more!
What happened?	Honey. What were you doing with that?	I#  I don't remember.
Not since we were kids.	I've stopped a hundred times.	So how's Tommy?
Are you okay?	What do you mean?	It's just#  you've been acting kinda strange, you know?
What the hell are you doing?	It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.	No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.
Nobody ever loved me that much.	And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?	You want my advice?
Here's to you, sir.	Er, good luck, yes.	I'd better be going.
Who are you really? And what were you before? What did you do and what did you think? Huh?	We said "no questions."	Here's looking at you, kid.
But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.	No, no, no, no. We must leave.	Yes, of course, we $ 
Oh. I saved my first drink to have with you. Here.	No. No, Rick. Not tonight.	Especially tonight.
Can I tell you a story, Rick?	Has it got a wow finish?	I don't know the finish yet.
$  All right. I tried to reason with you. I tried everything. Now I want those letters. Get them for me.	I don't have to. I've got them right here.	Put them on the table.
I can't fight it anymore. I ran away from you once. I can't do it again. Oh, I don't know what's right any longer. You'll have to think for both of us, for all of us.	All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.	I wish I didn't love you so much.
But why my name, Richard?	Because you're getting on that plane.	I don't understand. What about you?
When will he be back?	Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home.	Does he always leave so early?
This time they really mean to stop me.	Victor, I'm afraid for you.	We have been in difficult places before, haven't we?
Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on. Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?	Apparently he has the letters.	Yes?
Yes, Victor, I was.	I know how it is to be lonely.  Is there anything you wish to tell me?	No, Victor, there isn't.
Where were you last night?	That's so long ago, I don't remember.	Will I see you tonight?
Rick! Rick, help me!	Don't be a fool. You can't get away.	Rick, hide me. Do something! You must help me, Rick. Do something!
Boss!	Yeah?	Boss, ain't you going to bed?
Ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future?	No.	You ever going to bed?
What's that you're playing?	Just a little something of my own.	Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
Get up.	Feels so good to lie here.	Get up, damn you.
No more water, you said.	Take it.	No.
You know what happened to this?	As much as anybody.	Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.
Yeah, a long one.	I've got lots of time.	So do I.
Four four.  A record.	You don't seem too happy about it.	Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.
He is a cute thing.	He's your cute thing.	I can't even keep fish alive.
Why didn't you come over, get mad at me, tell me what a stupid bitch I was.	I guess I hadn't thought through how I felt.	What, you were going to come over the next day all calm and say, Kelly that really made me mad?  Don't tell me you're mad.  Be mad.  Be who you are right now.
I got married.	I thought you might have.	I would never $ 
To life.  Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.	To life.	That's all there is.
Take your time.	What?	That's what it's about.
Just tell me. I'll do whatever you want to do.	Nothing.	Isn't that like waiting and seeing?
I'm okay$ I can walk.	I don't want you to walk$ I want to carry you. Should I put the top up? It might get cold.	No$ keep it down. I want to feel the air.
I thought they might take me.	They wanted a girl.	Nobody ever wants me!
Did you bite it?	I don't remember.	It looks like you bit it$ it'll be all right.
I wonder if you might give me a ride.	Sure! Be glad to! Uh#  a ride where?	Where are you going?
What's that?	It's just my heart.	What you got a picture of your heart for?
You're not yet three months, are you?	Not yet. What do you know about it?	I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
We were back on.	After you cut her loose.	She walked.
Come here. Feel this.	No thanks. I'm good.	Come here!
You told me to change my hair!	What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're dead!	Did I miss something?
How do you deal with $ 	WHAT?	I SAID, HOW DO $   Deal with that?
What about# 	What about what?	What about the money?
Meet me at my place later.	How do you know the King's going to let you walk?	I'm getting a ride.
When this is all over, you're going to tell me who the King put on Al.	You going to have the time?	I'll find the time.
What are you doing?	High five.	Put your hand down. I don't high five.
Jack. Do you need a ride?	No. Thanks.	My car's in the garage.
How about fifteen hundred?	How about five hundred.	What?!
I found her in bed with someone.	Who was he?	She.

How did you hurt your hand?	Just an accident. Nothing.	Turn left ahead.
I'm in trouble.	What kind of trouble?	I owe a lot of money.
And I thought you were only after my body.	I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.	What'll you do when it all goes wrong?
I want you to forget what I said.	Wait a minute# 	No, forget it. The bet's off.
How much do you owe?	Let it go.	Did they tell you to sleep with me?
I'm sorry.	What for?	I have to take the car.
Is it yes?	Yes.	Thank you.
So how do you feel, your first night? I'll bet you're on a high.	Nice car.	She's my baby.
What are you, a cop?	If I see you do it again, I'll report it.	I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?
Hey Jack, join us.	No thanks.	Don't worry, I won't report you!
It didn't go off.	Oh, God# 	It didn't go off.
What are you gonna name it?	What?	The new star. What are you gonna name it?
Okay, okay.  I can explain#  You ever have to do something you really don't want to?	How I make my living, what's your point?	This.
Fine.  So call her.  Get her over here.	Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.	What?
Some of us are trying to sleep.	You didn't tell me you lived with her.	You know each other?
How're ya doin', Max.	You mean until you showed up?	You're not still pissed?
Damn#  Are you alright?	They took my daughter.	I know.
What makes you cry?	If I'm sad, or tired, or sometimes when I'm angry or when somebody's being mean to me.	Pretty much the same reasons I was crying.  But things will be better when we move to a new place.
Know where I can find her?	You don't want to.	But she does work here?
Say the words, "I understand."	I understand.	And if I ever catch you coming near my man again# 
Gotta go.	Where?	It's a secret.
Make the call.	She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.	She's got my word.

Now $  how many men you got in your army?	Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.	That's not fair $  we've only got fifty thousand.
I $  I may be wrong, but I suspect the Secretary of War.	Don't bother me - I'm thinking $  What was that?	I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.
Our man is sick. Come right away.	What is it?	Like this.

Stand up, John. Let them see you.	Oh no, I couldn't.	It's for you, John. It's all for you. Go ahead, let them see you.
Don't lie to me. I know all about it. You were SEEN. Where did you take him?	Take him? Now wait#  I didn't take him anywhere. We were just having some fun. We didn't hurt him#  just having a laugh, that's all.	HE'S GONE!
Open up! I know you're in there!	Ah! It's my father!	Open up! I know you're in there!
Right! Where is he?	Who, Father?	Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course!
WHAT did you say?	I said welcome.	WELCOME?
Please! Please! What are those?	What are what?	Those things in your hands.
What's the matter?	PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!	What?
WHY?	Yes.	But surely you know# ?
Have you ever felt like this about anyone else?	What#  you mean "got into bed with" them?	No, of course not, silly $  I mean FELT like this about them?
That's just what I was trying to tell you. You ARE# 	Five this week; how many the week before?	You're as bad as my father.
Then I shall come too.	No#  no# 	I don't want to live WITHOUT you.
How?	Well#  for a start#  er#  there's no killing# 	Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing.
I've come to take you back to the land of the living.	What a stupid idea.	Why?
"But" what?	But# 	What?
We're missing all the fun# 	What's it all about?	What?
Thank you VERY much indeed.	Now stop it!	It's SO nice to feel wanted.
There is another way.	Who gets killed?	Nobody gets killed.
How are you today?	Okay, I guess.	Here we are.
I just thought I'd say hi. I was in the neighborhood.	You were not.	I was not.
How are you today?	Okay, I guess.	Well, why don't you tell me what's going on? Do you mind if I turn this on?
I'm sorry.	Why?	Why what?
I don't need nice. I don't need myself to be it and I don't need anyone else to be it at me.	Okay.	Shit. Shit. I know it's here. Hold on.
Hi. I could give you a ride if you need.	No, that's okay. Thanks, though.	You're sure? It's cold.
God, that feels so fucking good. Take yours off.	I'm fine.	Yeah? Well, have a seat, anyway.
What do you want to hear?	You pick it.	You just say. I'm not really $ 
Oh shit. I remember this.  Want to go?	I want to have a baby.	Let's talk about it later.
I dropped you off after. You said $ 	Come up and see me#  now.	It's very late.
I told her today I need to end it.	Is that what you want?	I did it. I guess that means something.
I wish we did. You married?	Um, no.	Let's move into this neighborhood.
So you'll call me, right?	Yeah.	When?
Listen, did you want to make love?	Make love?	Have sex. Y'know $ 
Yeah?	Did you send this? Is it a joke?	I probably got the same thing as you.
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about $ 	You have to stop this!	What? What do you mean?
Hi.	Hi.	How was it?
So#  you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time?	It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.	I'm sorry.
I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do! Crap. Crap# 	Well, what should we do?	I don't know! I just said that!
He's coming?	You better go.	Hell no.
Hey.	Do you swear you didn't know?	I swear.
What's this?	Nothing.	I know what it is.
I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that.	I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.	I wish I was your wife. I wish I had your kids.
Yeah?	Just wanted to let you know.	I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit. I just don't think she likes me.
What are you doing?	Getting dressed. I've got to go.	But I don't want you to leave. Please stay. We can go to dinner. I owe you a dinner. And tonight#  we can#  really make love.
Your eyes# 	I don't need them anymore. Where we're going, we won't need eyes to see.	What are you talking about?
What are you?	You know.	You want me to believe you're the Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit!
There is no Devil. There is no God. There is only#  NOTHING.	You're lying# !	I'm not asking you to believe me. You'll see for yourself#  and so will your crew. You're all coming with me.
Thank you.	Captain, we got a problem.	Now what?
Everybody okay?	We're all here.	Okay. Let's find out how much time we just bought.
You got any coffee?	It's cold.	I don't care.
What are you doing here?	I'm worried about you.	About me? How sweet.
When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?	Five times.	I had it at four.
What the $ !	Ben. Are you okay?	Am I okay?! You wanna explain that?!
You're on fire!	Not this again $ 	No: You're ON FIRE!
Feeling better?	Yes, thanks.	That's good. That's uh#  good.
Uh, Sue# ? I can't.	What? What do you mean you $ 	Sue#  look at your hands.
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?	That's what we're here to find out.	If it happened to him, then it could# 
Please don't make this personal $ 	Oh, I think you already have.	Victor, we can't do anything until the research is ready.
Were those flowers really for me, Brad?	Of course.	How much did they cost?
Go ahead. Just make it quick.	Totally.	It's the first door on your left.
You're not going to tell me, are you?	No.	All right, then. It's your secret.
Why don't you take off your clothes, Mike?	You first.	How about both of us at the same time?
What's wrong?	I think I came. Didn't you feel it?	I guess I did.
Oh. Hi.	I didn't see you this morning.	Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.
What's going on?	Mike, there's something that's been on my mind and I have to tell you about it.	What? Now?
Hey, slow down. This is my brother's car.	I thought he was out of town.	He is.
My brother is going to kill us. He's gonna kill you and then he's gonna kill me. He's gonna kill us.	Just be glad you're all right.	My brother is gonna shit.
Was it great?	It was okay.	You'll always remember your first time.
What do you think it is?	What do you think it is?	It couldn't be.
You know, there's one thing you didn't tell me about guys.	What?	You didn't tell me that they can be so nice, so great#  but then you sleep with them and they start acting like they're five years old.
I think I've made my point with you tonight.	Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question?	What's that?
I think I better take you home.	What about those other guys you live with?	No. I mean back to your home.
Do you have Mrs. George for English?	Yeah. She is pretty good.	Yeah. She is pretty good.
Where's your brother?	I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink?	No. That's okay.
# I've got to go home.	Do you really have to go?	Well#  it's getting kind of late.
Stop!	What the fuck are you doing he's in there!	They can't get in here!  You said it yourself, they'll get in!
Are you two all right? Did you see that!? They left! We made it! I think we made it!	They'll be back.	Oh, come on! Can't you be happy for one split second? They're gone!
So, what now? Did those things leave?	Why don't you go check it out?	Fuck no.
We're going to get help.	We gotta try.	Anybody else?
You wanna see, baby?	Sure.	How much you got?
What?	What?	What do you mean what?
Fine, Chief.	Gimme the keys.	NO, but I will lock you in.
What?!	Move slow and move quiet.	No shit.
Go! Go!	Not without you!!!	Go!!!
Her name is Charlie.	Oh# 	She's still alive, I hope. I wouldn't have made it this far if it weren't for the chance of seeing my little girl again. I need to get to her.
Okay, but come here first.	Huh.	Come here. I want to show you something.
You learn your lines?	Sort of.	There've been some calls.
We're all square now, Harry. Right?	All square, Doc.	Good. 'Cause I don't want to see you again.
It's already started, Dad#  with me.	I know.	And I can't understand how it can hurt to be honest, but the more I tried to explain $  
What do I do, Dad?	You really want to go?	Of course.
# So what do you think?	I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you.	I know that, Dad, but $ 
I'm going back to the hotel.	Good.	See you next weekend?
Age?	Fifteen.	Address?
Hi, Harry. Did you see the play?	You think I'd miss it?	Well? What'd you think?
Honest. When you were up there, you were really#  there, know what I mean? Everyone else looked stupid.	I don't know#  I did#  feel different#  Alive.	Yeah, it's a gift. You gotta do something with it.
There's just one more thing.	What's that?	Will you marry me?
It's going to be slow from now on. Do you know what I mean, Harry?	I'm not sure.	Very slow.  But we're not going to stop, are we?
Goodbye, Harry. It was very good to see you again.	Yes. Would you like me to walk a little way with you?	That would be okay.
Yeah.	What'd you do?	You know, I've never been able to figure that out.
What happened? Who're you?	Who're you?	I live here.
I'm not!	Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire!	But I want to. I'm trying!
How's it sound?	The speech? Real good.	You think I got it?
I think I need a little air.	What's wrong?	Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile.
I'll have lunch ready by one.	I'll be back.	At one. Promise?
Where are you going?	I'm going out!	You're not going anywhere!
You were with him at the end.	Yes.	I was watching.
Come warm yourself if you like.	You speak.	Yes, I speak. And read. And think#  and know the ways of Man.  I've been waiting for you. Two months now.
What can I do?	There is something I want.  A friend.	Friend?
Soon?	Yes. I want this over and done with.	I'll be waiting. And watching.
What kind of God is He to will this?	She was mother to me as well. But ours is the job of the living. It's up to us now to hold this family together. We must think of Father and be strong for him.  I cannot do that alone.	God took her from us.
Brother and sister still?	I wish to be your husband.	I wish to be your wife.
Our decision. Together.	Your decision. For us.	I give you my soul# 
Quite a place.	Thank you, Henry.	For what?
Shows how much you know. It's something about tomorrow.	Tomorrow is another day.	Right! Right!
I think we should go wake them up. Just in case.	Give them a little while longer. It's still early, anyway.	I guess# 
How come you're leaving?	It's long and personal. It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.	Maybe I can help?
You saved my life.	I had to.	Thanks.
Did anyone ever tell you you're beautiful when you're angry?	I don't believe you# 	Want to see my trick shot? It's even better.
Yeah. I got it on before this $   $  all started.	That's thirty percent.	For two lonely nights.
How many with you?	Just my son and I.	What is your purpose in Mexico?
What was that?	Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.	You said it was just you and your son.
You don't believe in suicide.	It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two# 	Okay, I'll kill you when you change, I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name.
Not a chance.	Come again?	If you're taking people, take me. But my kids aren't going anywhere with you.
Who's this?	My wife.	Where is the little lady?
I'm going for 'em!	No!	Everybody goes home!
What?	Where are you taking us?	Mexico.
You got three minutes. One second longer, I shoot your father in the face. Do you understand what I just said?	Yes.	Do you believe me?
This isn't gonna work.	Shut up. It's gonna work just fine,	I just want to go on record as saying this is a bad idea.
You okay?	Yeah, I think so. What happened?	I don't know, you just passed out.
How?	Where are you right now?	What do you mean?
Shit.  Think we're had.	Smoke her.	I ain't gonna shoot her.
Do you?	No.	I'm so glad we agree.
You okay?	It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this.	You made a mistake.
Is this cause of me? Because of the story?	Well what the hell did you think was going to happen?	You never said it was off the record.
Not for a long time, now.	Well, I think you're cute.	Oh, thank you.  Is she always like this?
Do I know you?	We've met before.	Oh yeah, the insurance guy.
NO!  WE'RE ALMOST THROUGH!	DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!	KEEP GOING! KEEP GOING!
Oh good, there's nothing to eat.	Why didn't you stop at the market?	I still haven't got this bloody thing off.
Go. They're off again.	Up.	What?  Up?
Guy, you're not going to get killed on the planet, okay?	Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?	Your last name.
Wait. When are you going to tell them?	Tell them? About# 	Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?
Commander?#  Where are you#  going?	Home.	You#  You mean Earth?
Not today.	I want you to see our hospital.	I don't want to see your hospital.
But first I want to know who I'm talking to. Am I talking to you, or am I talking to him?	You can talk to me.	That's what I thought. So let me put it this way# 
I can hear you, but where the fuck are you, man?	What I been wondering is where's he been.	Yeah, where've you been? We haven't heard from you lately.
What?	Look at me, Ray.	You say look at you?
I'm looking at you.	I want you to keep looking right here, okay?	That's what I'm doing.
You're not looking at me, Harry.	Why do I have to keep looking at you?	I want you to.
You pack a gun?	Not really.	What does that mean?
What?	I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought#  I told you to keep your mouth shut.	I had to tell 'em something.
So you don't know what I'm thinking.	No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious.	So you want to know.
How about this?	That's not bad.	That's what I think of you, asshole. Nothing.
The interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand?	That's right. Three percent.	But a week. That's a hundred and fifty percent a year.
That why you came over here, to ask me that?	I want to know.	Why does anyone want to be in movies?
Yeah?	Yeah. There's a girl in it now.	Really.
Were you scared up there?	You bet.	You don't act like it?
I hate to say I told you, but I did. I told you don't start nothing with him that time.	You said don't say nothing and I didn't.	No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
What's wrong?	Be quiet and listen.	I don't hear anything.
Guess I'll just keep working.	What're you crazy?	I like my job.
Can't you use something else?	I might be able to find something on the ship. But it's gonna take time.	Do what you need to do. Just do it fast.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?!	I don't know what you're talking about?	I think you know.
You're late.	Sorry.	Don't fall asleep.
You okay?	Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.	What?
Take it easy, you'll live longer.	Did you see him?	Who?
How's he doing?	Same. Any luck?	No. I'll try again later.
Hey.	Hey.	Couldn't sleep.
She said the ship was evil. That we had to leave right away. That if we didn't, we might never leave.	What's that supposed to mean?	I don't know.
What happened?	We hit land.	What?
Will you get off my back for once?	It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training.	Look, I told you I'm not going to college.
What's wrong with you?! Tell him I'm not here!	But I can't $ 	JUST DO IT!
Do you want something to drink?	Why?	What do you mean "why"?
So, when are we going to start looking for our apartment?	Soon#  I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes.	Did you sign up yet?
So what should we do?	Wait#  I just want to see what's on this tape.	What is this?
You call.	Why do I always have to do it?	You're better at it.
There he is# 	As always.	Waiting for the bus that never comes# 
Give me all your money, bitch!	Where did you get that?	You won't believe it! Guess!
Now are you going to get a regular job?	Don't worry.	If it makes you feel any better, I don't think you could've gotten more than ten bucks for all this stuff.
I'm sorry about the other day. I don't know what's wrong with me#  I really do want to move in with you.	I don't know#  I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week.	Please let me come with you. Please please please# 
We're not.	Really? Both of you?#  Why not?	Just because.
Hi#  what's your name?	Norman.	# are you waiting for a bus?
Thanks for the tape - I'll have to pay you later, I'm broke.	Hey, where are you going?	Later, "Dude".
That's five hundred dollars.	What?	Five hundred.
Yes, that would certainly do# 	Well, offer her a seat! You want me to do it?	Wait a minute! Hang on! Jesus, I gotta think of something to talk to her about. No! No# 
Wow, this is so cool# 	If you don't mind my asking $  why do you care so much if I get a date or not?	I dunno#  because I can't stand the idea of a world where a guy like you can't get a date# 
Uh#  hello?	Hi, it's me# 	Oh, hi# 
I'm going to this stupid art show and I want you to be my date#  There's something I have to show you# 	I#  I don't know. I don't really think I should# 	Of course you should. C'mon, I'm already a million hours late.
What are you doing here?	I had to see you.	What's up?
I am a man of peace.	Am I to take it you want to live?	Most certainly. Absolutely. Yes.
You're certain about tomorrow?  But you don't seem excited. 	You don't enjoy killing, do you? 	Then why do it?
I didn't have a chance to thank you.	What did I do?	Got me out of trouble.
It's certainly the best chance they've had to kill you.	You think they'll come then?  Why?	Good luck.
You like him, don't you?	Oh yes. But it takes time.	You've known him long?
No, you didn't, Frank.	Okay, that's no problem.	That's exactly what you said last week.
So this is what you do, huh?	Oh, hello, Peter.	You're really good, you know.
Should we go?	I don't think we should leave her alone.	You're right.  We should stay.
Six feet $  seven $  eight $ 	That's it.  It's on the bottom.	Nine feet $  ten $ 
Ready?	I'm ready.	Then let's do it.
Now that's one ugly dude.	Huh?  What?	You finished here?
Are you telling me how to drive?	No, I just thought $ 	Well don't think!
Now where are you going?	To the bathroom, where do you think?	Have I done the right thing?
That's too bad.	What?	Nothing.  Is that the kitchen?
Uh-huh.	Well, let's check it out.	I'll wait here if you don't mind.
Damn!	Are you all right?	Yeah, yeah.
Do you want this body?	Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.	Take me now.
All right.  What is it?	A square?	Good guess $  but no.
All right.  I'll try.	I'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning.	All right, Peter.  Good night.
I told you it's real.	What do we do now?	I don't know.  Talk to it.
Ray $  Something's here.	Where are you, Pete?	Third floor.  Get down here,
It's here, Ray.  It's looking at me.	Don't move.  It won't hurt you.	How do you know?
Don't stop to visit $  take the children straight home and I'll follow as soon as I can.	Tomorrow?	As soon as I can.
General, do you realize what happened out there today?	I didn't get killed and everyone else did.	That's one way to look at it.
You're living at home now. Is that right?	Yes.	Do you know what you're going to do?
Aren't you eating?	No.	Why not?
Will you take me home now?	I'm sorry I took you in there.	I think I'd better go home now please.
I want to go home.	But could I just tell you this one thing?	What?
Listen $  could you stop crying, please?	No, I couldn't.	But could you try?
Would you like to come in? I could make some coffee.	No, I mean $  I wouldn't want to wake anyone up.	We won't. Let's go inside.
Do you?	Yes.	You're the first $  you're the first thing for so long that I've liked. The first person I could stand to be with.
Was she married or something?	Yes.	With a family?
All right.	During the day? We'll go for a drive or something.	Okay.
What is it?	That woman $ 	What?
No $  don't cry $ 	GET OUT!	Don't cry. 
Is that him over there?	No.	Where did he say he was going to meet you?
I said I think it is.	All right then! Yes!	Well, I want you to leave.
Why?	Because it isn't true.	I don't feel well.
Are you going home?	No.	Well $  where are you going?
You won't?	I don't know.	But you might.
Elaine $  are you serious about this?	I'll think about it.	You really will?
Are we getting married tomorrow?	No.	The day after tomorrow?
Ben $  I just want to say one word to you $  just one word $ 	Yes, sir.	Are you listening?
What's that?	I said $  not exactly $  no.	What are you then?
I'm putting it here by the door.	Will you bring it in to me?	I'd rather not.
Yes sir?	A room. I'd like a room, please.	A single room or a double room?
Is it a girl?	Is what a girl?	Whatever it is you're upset about.
You don't?	No. 	Let's go.
Will you come in, please?	What?	I want you to come in till I get the lights on.
Are you always this much afraid of being alone?	Yes.	Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?
I really don't want to put this on again. Won't you bring it up?	Where is it?	On that chair in the hall.
Don't be nervous.	Get away from that door.	I want to say something first.
Did you get us a room?	What?	Have you gotten us a room yet?
Now $  do you think we could say a few words to each other first this time?	If you want.	Good. I mean are we dead or something?
How do you get out of the house?	I walk out.	You walk right out the door.
What do you say to him?	He's asleep.	Always?
Well you loved him once, I assume. When you first knew him.	No.	What?
Why did you do that?	See if you can guess.	Well I can't.
But I thought you $  I guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then.	Kind of.	Well how did it happen?
What kind of car was it?	What?	Do you remember the make of the car?
Don't talk about Elaine.	Don't talk about Elaine?	No.
What are you doing?	Well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more.	Well look $  I was kind of upset there.  I'm sorry I said those things.
I drive around.	What else?	Nothing else.
Well why do you $  why do you think that?	Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.	Oh. Well, I don't. Shall I tell you what I do?
They don't know?	No $  they don't.	Well $  when did you decide all this?
I'm just $ 	$  worried?	Well $ 
What's happening?	Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.	I don't believe it.
I want to speak $ 	Not now.	Yes, sir.
Never?	You're a fool!	Yes, I am rather.
He must be very nice.	Who?	Whoever is keeping you waiting.
That was lovely.	Will you do me a big favor?	I'll do anything for you.
So you feel like coming into a lady's room $  and you come#  What now?	I'd like to smoke a cigarette.	Certainly.
Why do you look at me like that?	I did not know you were so beautiful#  and $ 	And then $ ?
I'm worried about you.	Don't.	On the train?
That was my last.	You've lost everything?	I've no luck.
Shall I tell them again?	Why waste time $  it's getting late.	You see $  what we are interested in $ 
What? Me?	That's just the first year. If you aren't worth a lot more than that the second year, I'll kick you out. What do you say?	Well, uh#  No.
Well, uh# 	Sure, sure, that doesn't count. That's different.	Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out.
Get well soon.	Every day in every way.	I'll see you when you get home.
Yeah?	Open your door.	What?  What for?
Don't I get any say in this?	No! Because I $ 	That's what I say.
Oh, Jesus.	No question, huh?	No, its $  Why did she$ ?
Mind if we sit down?	I'd prefer you didn't.  I'm very busy.	Okay, then how 'bout we ask you a few questions?
Where are you going?	To the bathroom.  Can I do that alone or do you want to watch?	I thought you'd never ask.
Shit, John!  What the hell were you doing out there?!	Nothing.	You're kidding with that answer, right?
Not me.	Why not?	I can't afford to get caught.
What are you doing here?!	I came to see you.	I can see that.  Why?
You look kind of cold.	I'm okay.	Here, take my jacket.
Aren't they doing a terrific job this year?	Looks great.  It does.	You okay?  You seem a little off.
It's John, isn't it?	It's always John.	Still wants to move out?
Hey, you alright?	What?	What are you looking at?
Mommy, I'm scared.	There's nothing to be scared of, baby. It's just another storm.  Try to get some sleep.	I can't.  The voice man is coming to get me.
My, God!  What have you done to him?	I didn't $  He got in a fight and I $ 	You stay away from him!
No!!!	Stay away, Sam.	Leave the boy.  Take me.

Dad?	Who was it?	It's Mom.
Then speak, by God!  Can you fight with words?	I don't want to fight you.	Get mad!  Tell me you don't like the way I treat your mother!  Tell me you wish I'd never come home!
You know what I want?  I want you both to be friends.  I know you both, respect you both. You should be friends.	Nothing would please me more.	Thank God!
Awful.  I can't tell you how sorry I am.	Say hello to your mother.	Do say hello to your mother.
Well$ what have we here?  A family.	Almost a Christmas scene.	Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
Look$ I'm sorry$ I have to go.	We'll miss you so.	Look$ this isn't my apartment, and there isn't anybody else here.  Mrs. Ryan won't be home for a while.
No.  No.	Get up.	No.
Don't touch me.	Wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him?	No.
Mom?	That man is your father.	What?
Really?	It is an emergency, isn't it?	Yeah.
I didn't get his name.  A friend of your father?	He isn't any friend of Father.	He isn't?
Did you see him?	Yeah.	Is he all right?
Possibly.	How long has this been going on?	A week.  We were waiting for the right time to$

You're not exactly the type we're looking for.	You mean I'm black?	No, just not the type.
Now, what do you want?	I said I just wanted to talk to you# 	That's cool.
Hello. You want some information?	Yeah.	We offer# 
Are you the star of this picture?	You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight.	The other girl is the star?
Are you a private detective?	Something like that. How much do you make?	Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl.
You have anything to drink? You want to go out and get something?	I don't drink, but you can go out.	You don't drink?
Look, I really don't know your daughter but# 	But what?	I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life.
Where is she?	I don't know.	Where did you get that film?
I'm only human, you know.	Get out.	But this is my apartment.
You can fuck off, too.	You're taking a big chance.	I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway.
Haven't we met before?	None of that, lady.	Oh, well. Must have been your brother.
Eh, no. Thank you.	You're welcome.  Did you know him?	Eh, no.
Can I drop you anywhere, Harold?	No, thank you. I have my car.	Well then, I must be off.  We shall have to meet again.
Do you dance?	What?	Do you sing and dance?
What do you think?	Oh. Eh, I like it.	No, you have to touch it.  You have to run your hands over it, get close to it, really reach out and feel. You try it.
What happened?	Look.	What?
Look at the stars.	Yes. They're old friends.	Do you think there is any life up there?
I don't think I'm getting through to Mother like I used to.	Does that worry you?	Yes. It does.
Harold?	Huh?	You don't seem to be listening. I asked do you have any friends?
I see. Tell me, Harold, do you remember your father at all?	No.  I'd have liked to.	Why?
She's done it.	She certainly has.	It's coming.
I have to go back. Or it'll never stop.	What are you talking# 	I've got to finish it.
But I didn't open it! I didn't!	Then why are you here?	I've come for my father!
Well, you did break out $ 	I wanted to see her.  It's nobody's business.	It is. You got yourself on TV again.
Keep her safe. No matter what. I'll deal with whatever's back there.	Alone?	How big can it be?
He $  loves you.	I know.	What about you?
But it's not true, is it?	What $  ?	That you feel that way about me.
Hello, I'm $ 	$  Late. Five minutes late.	Yes, I $ 
Christ!	What's the problem?	My fucking hand!
It's my lucky day.	Hi.	Want to buy a bed?
What's happening?	We're leaving.	Where's my father?
That your daughter?	Uh-huh.	Got her mother's looks.
No.	One last time. Give me the box.	You want it?
You bastard $ 	Poor baby.	Bastard.
There is going to BE a wedding?	Oh.  Oh yes.	Well can I come in or not?
Well?	I don't want to see the dress.	But you said $ 
Help me.	Tell me who you are.	Frank.
No. God no.	Believe me. It's me. It's really me.	What happened to you?
You can't love him.	I don't.	So where's the harm?
She'll tell them everything# 	I don't think so. She'll want Larry first.	That's probably her now. Or the police.
You look terrible. Have you had an accident?	I was here this afternoon.	This afternoon.
Maybe somebody changed the lock.	Like who?	Just a thought $ 
Well?	Why not?	We'll move in Sunday.
Are you all right?	Fine.	Only I'll turn it off $ 
Oh baby.	Don't go upstairs.	Come with me then.
Huh?	Please# 	What's wrong with you?
What's wrong?	I don't know where to begin# 	What are you talking about?
Not much fun, is it?	What?	Drinking alone.
You know it's not often I#  you know# 	There's a first time for everything.	I suppose that's right.
Well, isn't it?	I#  suppose so, yes.	So, what's your problem? Let's get to it.  You're not going to change your fucking mind ?
Is this your place ?	Do you care ?	No, not much.
I thought you were going to stay with us for awhile?	No Dad.	You'd like the house.
Great.	Well come over, will you? See the place?	Maybe later in the week. First I've got to find myself a job.
Big house.	You like?	Me like.
# maybe we should never have come back.	Maybe you should give it some time.	I guess.
She doesn't even want to leave the house.	Really?	It's like she's waiting for something.
Poor Frank. He's better off dead.	I don't believe it.	I'm afraid it's true.
Get the fuck out of here.	What's the problem?	PLEASE. You're in danger.
I'm here.	I thought we'd lost you.	I'm coming!  Sleep well.
You know I do know the way home.	It's late.	Not that late.
Oh no?	Oh no.	It's not what I heard.
Oh!	Are you alright ?	I've been better.
What the fuck is that?	What?	I heard you, man.  Don't give me that "what" shit.  You just told them that you're gonna put out a record with them.
Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm off the phone.	You look upset.	I'm upset, but I'm fine.
So shall we leave it at that then?	I dunno.	Think about it, Rob.
Shit!	Hi.	Hi.
So.  Where have you been staying for the last week?	I think you know that.	Had to work it out for myself, though, didn't I?
I'm sorry.  I haven't been very fair to you.  That's why I came here to the store this evening.  I feel terrible, Rob.  This is really hard, you know.	Good.  So.  Is it my job?	What?  Gimme a fucking break.  Is that what you think?  That your not big enough a deal for me?  Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob.
And anyway, I keep trying to tell you, that's not really the point, is it?  The point is we got ourselves into an awful mess, Rob#   Are you there?  What are you thinking?	Nothing.	We can meet for another drink if you want.  So I can explain it better. I owe you that much.
Hello.	It's me.	I figured it was.  Where are you?
I called and called but you were out.  I thought I'd be gone before you got back.	Is that the last of it?	Yep.  I might have missed some stuff. I'm so used to some things being here that I don't even notice them.
I'm sure.	You still together?  Going all right?	I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.
I'm sorry.	No, no.  When are you going home?	In a minute.  When I get it together.
Me?	My dad liked you.  And Mom never told him we'd split, because he wasn't up to it and#  oh, I don't know.  I don't really understand it.  I think she thinks he'll be able to see what's going on.  It's like#   He's been through so much, what with dying and everything, that she doesn't want to upset him any more than she has to.	Do you want me to be there?
C'mon.  I want to know.	Want to know what, exactly?	What it was like.
Hi.	Hi.  What are you doing?	Nothing.
Are you going to talk to me, or shall I get my paper out?	I'm going to talk to you.	Right.
Are you okay?	Yes.  You?	For now.  But I wouldn't be if I thought this was the end of the evening.
Which way are you going?	That way.  You?	That way.
These are worth at least, I don't know $ 	I know what they're worth.  Give me fifty and get them out.	But you must have $ 
With eleven hundred he could come home, and that's the last thing I want.	I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else.	Fine.
Jesus Christ.	You'll be safe here.  He won't kill in a church.	Why not?
Who is he?	At the moment?  Carl Smith.	And you?
No.	No one knows you're here?	No.  I had to talk to you.
You did kill those men.	Not all of them.	When you finish, what then?
No.  So what now?  We just wait?	Yes.	Well, as long as we're stuck here.
Who are you?	That would be difficult to explain.	I'd like you to try.
I'm calling an attorney.	You and I should talk first.	We've got nothing to say.
I did at that.	And but for a mark you are well as any man, no?	Aye.
Three days you've laid there. It's time you ate.	This can't be.	You are not dead, boy.  Accept it.
Why does he want to kill me?	You recall how I spoke of the push you feel and how I make it less?	Aye.
Oh please.  Another one.	What would you like?	Something pretty.
That's wonderful.  Where did you ever learn it?	Far away.	Kiss me.
Do not turn your back on me.	You are really going to force this, aren't you?	Either you are with me or against me.
I want people in here to check over every piece of this stuff.	Figure she's with him?	Yeah.
Where!	I don't know.	What name is he using?
Smith.  Carl Smith.	How many came?	The last four.
What's the point?	This isn't done.  Get up.	What's the point!  You have me, finish it!
Look, I don't know what the hell you're up to, but I think I've got a pretty good idea.	Do you?	All I need is time.
All right, dear.	Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got that money?	The five hundred? Sure.
Oh, she was here.	Where'd she go?	Out some place.
Well, I'll try to give her one.	I know you will, Bruce. Are you going to live with your mother?	Just for the first year.
Well, I got to get back. You can find your way out, can't you?	Oh, sure.  Well, thanks for everything.	Don't thank me. I should thank you. So long.
Then what does he want with you?	Now you got me.	Nothing personal. I was just asking.
Anything you want, Boss.	Beat it out and get hold of some guys.	Who do you want?
Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?	I think it is.	I thought so. Come on, I'm in a hurry.
How much?	Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?	It's a deal. Let me up.
Where'd you get this?	I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.	Not this gun!
All right. Tell 'em to shoot to kill.	What?	Shoot to kill, I said.
Mother!	That man there!	Mother! Oh, I'm so glad to see you! Are you all right? Tell me.
Go and ask her if she wants to play.	Ask her yourself.	You do it. You're a girl.
Can't we just see the end?	They've got the real thing outside.	It's not the same.
I'm glad you didn't send them to your aunt.	I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.	Where to?
Tell me the truth. You had to get married, didn't you? Because of me.	The ideas you get in your head.	That's why you never liked me. I'm different from you. Well, everything's different now, so it doesn't matter. So there.
Is it peace in out time?	No, Mother! It's War! War!	Or what?
How much further?	Almost there#  are you in a hurry or something?	Well, yeah, kind of.
Christ, you scared the shit out of me.	Aw, you ain't seen nothing yet.	Is your brother ready to go?
Can I help you with something?	I was just wondering.	Wondering what?
Go around him.	There's not enough room.	Then run him over, he'll move.
Fine. I'll go straight.	What!	Fine! I'll go straight!
Yeah, Jerry, she said some pretty fucked shit to us.	When?	When you were outside with Bill.
What was that?	What? I didn't hear anything.	Wait#  quiet. Turn off the radio.
My little French.	Stop. Get away.	What is it?
Like what?	Well, I think it would be easier if I could talk to you in person.	What for?
Well?	God, you're beautiful.	Please. I look a mess.
What are you doing in there?	I'll be out in a minute.	I'm sorry about my parents.
Did you see that?	What?	I don't know. Something.
I want to talk to you.	Do we need words?	Yeah, I think we do. We could try to cut each other up. But that would be bad for everybody. Bad for me, bad for you. And worst of all, be bad for Eddie.
I'll make it up to you.	How?	You tell me.
How much?	Oh, about five hundred.	Do you really think you can beat him?
Make it twenty.	Cut.	Deal.
How do we stand?	'Bout even.	When do I raise the bet?
I'll beat him the next game.	How're the hands?	They're fine.
Please don't get off me now.	I know when to quit. You don't. Win or lose, you don't know when to quit.	What do you want me to do, huh? What do you want me to do? Just say it and you got it but PLEASE don't get off me now.
What are you trying to do, Eddie? You beat him. You beat him bad. You wanna kill yourself?	What are ya, chicken, Charlie?	Well, maybe that's it. I'm chicken.
Hello, Charlie#   C'mon in#   That's my girl.	Hello, Eddie's girl#   I looked all over for you.	Oh yeah? How'd you find me?
Oh, I don't want to be no bother to nobody.	Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It don't look good on you.	How do you want me to play it? I'm broke.
With what?	Don't worry about it. I'll raise the money.	Oh yeah? Where?
You gentlemen care for a drink?	No, none for me. Come on, let's play.	By all means.
How long you been waiting?	What?	How long have you been waiting?
What time does the bus leave?	What bus?	Yours.
Have a nice trip?	Fair.	Can I sit down?
Why did you do that?	I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.	A day like any other. People come, people go.
What time is it?	Eleven o'clock#  I'll be back later.	Why?
I got my things over at the hotel. I'll bring them over later#   Come here.	I'm not sure#  I don't know.	Well, what do you want to know? And why?
You know, I've been living here for almost three years. Now in three days it seems as if I know everybody. When I pass people on the street I want to stop and say, "Listen, I got a fella."	Thanks.	Eddie, where do you go when you go out?
Eddie, what's in that case?	Haven't you opened it?	No, why should I? It's yours.
Give it to me.	What's this supposed to mean?	Give it back to me.
You can read it, if you want to.  You want to go out for a while? To a movie?	You wanna drink?	No. You?
Well, what's so funny?	Your tie. I never saw you wear one before.	First time for everything.
What is it, Eddie?	Nothin'.  Want another drink?	What do you want to tell me?
If you don't mind I think I'll stay at the hotel.	Well, what's the matter?	I'm a little tired.
Go on back to the hotel.	Please, Eddie, don't beg him.	Would you go on back to the hotel? Take a cab, go on back to the hotel.
Your shot.	You miss?  Well, you don't leave much when you miss, do you, fat man?	That's what the game's all about.
Are you all right?	Yes.	Do you want to go on?
Do you remember where it is?	What?	Where you lived with them.
You want to find them.	Yes.	You want to kill them.
What do you want?	What do you mean?	You know what I mean.
Mine.	Have you always had it?	I don't know.
Need some gas?	Please.	Only got one kind.
We're going to be moving, son.	Do we have to?	I know, son.  But you'll like it where we're going.  I'm getting a good job.  It's a pretty part of the country.
What did he talk to you about?	He was upset with moving, I believe.	Is that all he said?
This is a new town for you.  Do you like it here?	No.	Why not?  Moving is hard for anybody.  Was it hard for you to leave all your friends?
I swear it was here.	But it's not, Jimmy.	No.
Stay here.  I'm going to make a phone call.	Who are you calling?	The State Police.
Well, come on, you two.  Time to go to bed.	Mom $  this is the best show all year.	I know.  But you have a full day of school tomorrow $   You, too.
When?	This afternoon.  It's wonderful up there $  you still haven't seen the best part.	I have school.
What do you want me to do?	I want you to leave with us. Right now.	I can't leave. We have to tell this to the President.
You still believe in him.	He's a good man.	Better be. You left me for him.
Are you all right?	Did it work?	You bet it did.
Tell her to get the kids and leave town.	What happened?	Just do it!
David, David! What the hell are you doing!?	I'm making a mess.	This I can see.
We're loose!	Doesn't matter. Game's over.	I don't hear no fat lady.
Wait. I have to tell you something.	What?	Be careful.
Before we do this, I want you to know I'm sorry.	Sorry for what?	I should have done this a long long time ago.
Why did you people come here?	Air#  water#  your "sun."	Where do your people come from?  Where is your home?
You know how long I've been looking for that?!	All your life.	All my life!
The Word of God# 	No, Henry. Try not to talk.	The Name of God#

It is you Junior!	Don't call me that, please.	But what are you doing here?
No! Dad, get your stuff. We've got to get out of here.	Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them.	Dad, they come in through the doors.
Found it.	He was actually there? You saw him?	Well, what was left of him.

What'd he say?	He told me they knew I was coming here.	What do you mean $  how?
What's happening?	It's starting to let go!	That's good $  you're doing fine.
Wait $  what're you doing?	I'm going down.	Down? Down there?! Are you crazy!
What?	You've got to go to sleep now.	I want to go home# 
Where are you,# Al?	You're not gonna believe this# 	Try me.
You're in my head# 	Yes.	Your name is Al# 
Somebody's been here.	Where are we now?	My place, can't you see?

You sure this will work?	Not sure at all.	Well at least talk it up, then. I feel like an idiot.
Do it.	I can't handle that thing.	Don't worry, I can.
Do something.	What exactly?	I don't know.
Be quiet.	Where've you been?	Never mind that, where are we now.
I don't know how we're gonna get out of this, but we will, somehow.	I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done.	I want to thank you for what you've done.

What?	He's not what I expected. He's very $  he's so $  happy.	But you're going through with it?
Wait#  He wants to give her# ?	Nothing.	And she has# ?
Where are you taking me?	South America.	South America!
I haven't seen you cry since you were a baby. This must be serious.  Where'd you meet him?	On the road.	Now, don't tell me you fell in love with a bus driver!
No, thanks. We're not hungry.	Oh, I see, young people in love are never hungry.	No.
I better go over and see her.	Don't be silly. Nothing you can do. Must be tough on an old woman trip like this.	Yes.
What's the matter?	Oh, Peter	What's got into you?
I guess maybe I won't write that book after all.	Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try?	You! Don't make me laugh.
Thank you.  Am I going to see you in New York?	Nope.	Why not?
No harm in your coming to see us.	Not interested. 	Won't I ever see you again?
Where's the bus to New York?	Left twenty minutes ago.	Why, that's ridiculous! I was on that bus told them to wait!
Eight o'clock tonight.	Eight o'clock! Why, that's twelve hours!	Sorry, Miss.
Here's your ticket, ma'am.	Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.  Here.	Oh, thank you. Thank you.
Funny couple, ain't they?	Yeah.	If you ask me, I don't believe they're married.
See that. They're gone!	Looks like it, don't it?  Here's the woman, ma.	Oh!!
Not a minute!	Better start gettin' into your clothes.	Yeah.
Huh?	There's a seat over there for you.	What's the idea?
All right, all right.  Break it up.	Where you going, boss?	I don't know, Bill, I just don't know.
Did they live?	It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.	Don't be.  Nothing to be scared about, honey, I been through four years of war - this is nothing.
Pictures like this don't show up on television!	Sure they do.  The camera can pick this up.	No, it can't!
Here's my problem, Jack.  You told me you and Guy were good friends for a long time?	More than ten years.	And he never hit you before?
No, she could get hurt.  If you believe what's happening to these other people.	She's the best damn witness we have!	I just don't want to do it.  What else?
I understand.	Then say "Yes, Max. I understand."	Yes, Max, I understand.
What the fuck can I say? I'm serious, man. What the fuck can I say? Thank you#  thank you#  thank you.	Who was there for your ass?	You were there for me.
What's going on?	She wants to make a deal.	She sound scared?
How was your flight?	Fine.	Bet you're happy to be working again.
Four thirty. I'm meeting a woman.	What's her name?	He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her?
This is pretty.	Uh-huh.	Who is this?
How do you get it out?	Same way I been doin', but first they got to let me go back to work.	You're gonna offer to set him up?
How do you feel about getting old?	You're not old. You look great.	I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?
My ass ain't the same.	Bigger?	Yeah.
What're you, a bag lady?	I go back to work tomorrow.	You talk them into it?
I didn't use you, Max.	I didn't say you did.	I never lied to you.
Yes'm.	You know what's in the bag you're taking?	He say is a surprise.
And what would this be, Sweet and Low?	What the fuck is that shit?	I know what it looks like.
That's fifty thousand, huh? It doesn't look like that much.	I was told ten thousand in each pack.	You didn't count it?
Oh, hi.	Buy ya a beer?	I'm waiting for the phone.
You told them that?	It's true, isn't it?	What the fuck's that got to do with it?
When did you get out of jail?	Four days ago.	Where at?
It's Louis.	Did you get it?	I got it. Listen, there's something else I have to tell you.
Louis?	What?	Where's the rest of it?
Jesus Christ.	What?	You know who I saw in the dress department?
Comfortable?	The door was opened, so I just came right in.	I can see that. Why?
Somebody already did.	What?	You didn't hear?
It's the next street.	I know where it is.	Turn left.
He ain't here right now.	He leave town?	He's around.
Get me out of here.	Where do you want to go?	Take me home.
Remember?	No! That was years ago! I've lived years since then.	It's all been a dream.
By who? Why? Paul didn't have an enemy in the world.	How do you know?	Hey, you're talkin' about Paul. Who'd want to hurt him?
Wait #  Daddy.	Now what?	Don't go.
He say what they looked like?	No. Not really # 	Excuse me a minute. I'll be right back.
It's not worth goin' over again and again. Whatever happened, happened. It's over.	#  I've seen them, too.	Shit!
Perfect. We got it.  Okay. Let's just give it a little try. See if you can stand.	What? By myself?	You can do it. Come on. Easy. Just give it a try.
What do you think?	What do you mean?	The room!
Wait. Don't.	I don't like things that make you cry.	I just want to look # 
I'm going home.	What's wrong?	I don't know. One of these days, I'm gonna see Louis. My back's killing me.
Maybe it's all the pressure, Jake. The money. Things like that. Or your wife.	Why do you bring her up?	'Cause she's always on your mind.
You okay?	I wanna leave. Get me out of here.	Oh, come on. It's early.
What does it say?	It's gone to the top.	How high is that?
He's coming right over.	Coming here?	Goddamn it. Get in here. I can't stand around waiting.
You're out of your mind. I'm not getting in there. I'd rather die.	That's your decision.	Look at me. I'm ice cold.
Don't!	It might be for me.	I'm not here. You haven't seen me.
WHO ARE YOU?	How many times have you asked me that? How many times?	TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
Why won't you answer me?	Cause you know goddamn well who I am.	I don't know you.
WHO ARE YOU?	How many times have you asked me that? How many times?	TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
I can't move.	Just relax.	What's happening? Help me.
Still married, Jake?	Nope.	You and everybody else. God I hate this area. Makes me nervous.
It's okay, Paul. It's okay.	I don't know what to do.	Don't do anything.  Paul, I know what you're talking about.
I have some ice from the machine.	Bring it in.	Is he all right?
Asshole that does not count as a kill.	Yes it does.	Oh, come on!
His mother?	What?	I don't know. Nothing.
What the hell are you doing?	My job.	Fine, just stay out of my way.  Hit it.
Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though.	You just keep an eye out.	Yeah yeah. Got it.
You okay?!	Oh great# yeah, having a great time, and you?	No thank you, you crazy old woman.
They're not gonna make it. Close the door before he gets us all.	They'll make it.	Close the fucking door!
The power's back up!	Then open the doors!	Thirty seconds.
Damn!  Close the door! I'll be right back.	What?!!	I gotta go back.
You're not going anywhere.	You wanna die?	Are we locked down?
It's three feet deep, Martin	Michael! Come inside!	It's his birthday present, and you closed the beach, Honey. I told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday. I don't believe he'll ever do it again.
What's up?	I just wanted to come over. You know, say hi. I miss hanging out with you on school nights.	I miss it too.
Wait, let me take that.	Huh?	You shouldn't be carrying that heavy bag. I'll take it.
Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?	The doctor can tell, but I decided not to know. I want it to be a big surprise.	Well, it can really only go two ways.
What?	I actually know this one.	You do?
What?!	Either I just pissed my pants or# 	Or# 
What did you do?	I didn't do anything#  I just#  I've just been thinking.	What?
What would be a good time for you?	I don't know. There's just things I still want to do.	Like what? Be a rock star?
We're actually, finally doing this?	Looks like it, yeah.	Have you found a place to stay?
# Pardon?	# I said, I like your hair.	# Thank you.
That's me.	No it is not!	Hold still.
Can't hurt.	How much do I owe you?	Forget it.
# Well then, that's how many I killed.	If you say so.	Damn right I do.
I thought you wanted to be a writer.	# I do.	Then you can write anywhere. Let's get out of here, while we still can.
All set?	Fuck!	Take your time.
You gotta talk to her. She looks up to you, she'll listen to you.	I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work.	Then try again, 
Well, how was it?	Oh my god, so good. That girl can fuck.	She can fuck?
I don't understand why you do that.	Why I do what?	That.
So really, it's good luck.	Good luck?	Yeah, good luck. I mean what the fuck. The guy had no legs.
Yo, you think we killed that guy?	Na.	You sure?
You know I've been thinking about you lately.	You have?	Yeah. After I saw you last week.
I like you so much. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't believe it.	How do you know?	I just know. I know you'll love it.
You know what I want to do?	Yeah.	What do I want to do?
Dance!	What?	Come dance.
No. I'm OK. Thanks.	You're OK?	Yeah.
Yep.	Holy shit. That's all true?	No. I was just kidding.
Sorry. Dad made me promise not to give you any money until you find a job.	But then I won't need your money.	That's right.
So, how many people live here now?	I don't know, eight or nine.	Where does everyone sleep?
Yeah. And it takes them either too long or too short to come. Have you ever had someone that took forever	To come?	Yeah. I had sex with Jake, and it took him like an hour and a half.
We seem to have a little problem here?	What kind of problem?	I think you're lying.  That's what kind of problem.
You know, I figure that's pretty much how these girl's feel just before they get it.  You think I'm right?	I wouldn't know.	That's right.  I guess only the killer would know that.
A few people.	Did anyone stand out?	What do you mean, stand out?
Hello, Peter.	Who is this?	Someone who's going to become an important part of your life.  I want to play a game with you.
I did another one last night.  You might have saved her, but you didn't want to play.	Where is she?	You'll find her.
Hello?	Do you know what I'm doing right now, Peter?  I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to kill tonight.	You know her?
What's this?	Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter.  I hope you don't mind.	Of course not.
Why did he?	Why did he what?	Come here.
I know he really likes you.	How do you know that?  Did he say something?	No#  but I can tell.  A woman knows these things.
Same as the others?	Yeah.	How long she been dead?
Where were you last night?	Are we going to go through this again?	Answer the question.
Don't you understand what I'm telling you?  That's why he wants me out of the way.	I understand that this is just another one of your games.	Look, I'll do anything you want!  I'll sign anything you want!  Just send a car out to the hotel.
You have something you want to say?	Just thought you might want to talk.	About what?
I love this hotel.  I stay here every time I visit my parents.	How come you don't stay with them?	Because I love them, but they drive me crazy.  You know how parents are?
I think it's interesting.	Another kind of game?	In a way.
No.	You're not?	No $  I'm not involved.  And I plan on keeping it that way.
Relax.	How the hell can I relax after seeing what I just saw.	I know it was bad.
What?	Have you noticed that every time we start to talk about something serious you start to play games.	I'm not playing a game now.
Fine.	What do you want on it?	You.
Peter# 	No, listen.  You have no idea of the kind of pressure I'm under right now.	That's still no excuse.  You treat everything like a game.
This letter.  I've never opened it.	Why not?	Because I know what it says.
You beat him.	I got lucky.	There's a girl in the hospital who is going to live because of you.  You made a difference.
It's over now.	I just wanted you to know in case you thought about it in the future.	Do we have a future?
I lied.	About what?	I can't wait either.
Oh, she was so beautiful - and I was so ugly.	Would you desert your friends?	No, no. I'm with you, boy.
It is fifty years since I heard that name.	It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.	I was beautiful then.
YEAH! I was sure! Come on, tell me! I know him?	No.	Come on, shit, tell me! Is he beautiful?
Take# 	Well, I don't need them# 	Take them, you never know#  If you want to have some fun. Take, it's a gift.
Come on, get down!	You were scared, weren't you?	I was nervous, that's all! Where is the guy?
Not taken.	Why?	Too heavy.
# You don't believe me, don't you?	What?	When I say I love you.
You#  You knock the code, when you come back, OK?	Yes.	Three times, then two times.
He probably just went somewhere.	Where?	For a walk.  I don't know.
And your store?  What about your new store?  What about all your dreams?	I have new dreams now.	I don't accept that.
Are you two planning kids?	Maybe later.	You should definitely have children.  They're really special.
I know what you're getting at.	You do?	I've seen it before.
I do love you#  very, very much.	Show me.	I will $  I promise.
I thought we both wanted the same things.	I've changed my mind.	You can't change your mind.
I want children.	You've just decided, is that right?	Yes.
I don't know.	I think it's a different place for each person.	Did you have a dream?
What did they ask?	If I had seen you.  By the way I'm sorry about your wife.  They told me.	Thank you#  I'm sorry you had to lie.  It must have been difficult.
Why?	Do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death?	Most certainly.
You know what, I can play baseball with my brothers when I'm bigger.	Is that right?	You know what#  I'm just little now, but I'll be big soon.
Your parents would want you to be in bed.	You tell stories?	Oh no#  I'm not good at that. Very bad in fact# 
There are a lot of people worried about you.	Where am I?	In a hospital.
I've always wanted a watch like that.	It's yours.	No.  I won't take it unless I pay for it#  Let's see, that's a pretty nice watch $  I can see that.
I really want that watch.	This isn't right.	This is my only chance to get a watch like that.  It would mean a lot to me and my family.  Please take it.  It really isn't that much.
Hello!	Hello.	Are you working?
No, I came here to drink#  myself#  you know# 	To death?	Yes, that's right.
# or a girlfriend, but if you have some free time#  maybe we could have dinner.	Are you serious.	I think you know I'm serious. I'll pay you if you like#  but I'd like to see you.
First. It's our first. I'm just concerned. So#  why are you killing yourself?	Interesting choice of words. I don't remember. I just know that I want to.	Want to kill yourself? Are you saying that you're drinking as a way to kill yourself?
Why?	Because#  it's better for me that way. OK?	Well#  OK# 
I am planning to go out and do some work.	When?	Tomorrow night as a matter of fact.
What was that all about?	Can we just forget it?	I don't understand any of that.
I'll be back home around three. If you're back by then we can watch TV or something#  I guess what I'm saying is#  that I hope you are back when I get home. Please be careful.	You be careful to. I'm going to miss you.	Shall we go away for a couple of days?
I like it here with you.	Let's stay for a while.	OK.
Hey, Brad#  how's it going?	Hey Ben. There were a couple of guys looking for you.	What did they look like?
You have been lonely?	I've been all right.	I will keep you safe. We are both older.
Were you with another man?	Go to hell.	I'll take that as a no.
What're you so happy about? You're on trial for murder.	Get up.	What?
Did you hear a shot fired?	No. I was in the shower.	So at some point in the $  twenty minutes you were in the shower, your father was shot?
Why didn't you call me?	What?	We spend a beautiful night together and then I never hear from you again?
You ready?	No.	Yes, you are. Go $  you can do this.
Someone missed you.	Is he the only one?	What do you think?
How could this happen?	I don't know! I don't know anything any more!  I just need to be by myself.	Are you sure?
Neither.	Why not?	I'd rather have a client who's innocent.
What're you talking about? You're not here to see me?	No, silly. I go here.	You go where?
You promised!	Never.	But you did#  you did!
Sweet Jack.  I'm so sorry you found me asleep.  Don't know what came over me.	I can't have been under much more than a minute.	Seemed like weeks and weeks.  Such a terrible dream#  I could never tell you# 
He's not there.	He's here.  Check the bathroom.	I checked everywhere.  He's not there.
What's that for?	Mom said I should.	Oh.
What are you doing up so early?	I couldn't sleep last night.	I'm supposed to be mad at you, but I'm not.
He must.	He seems lonely.	Are you his friend?
You should stay.	I don't know.	Where's your dad?
Huh?	I can use your mom's.	I'm okay.
I don't wanna go.	He asked where you were!  He wants you with him.	I don't wanna go.
Why is that?	Just, I mean, well, you're here every single day.	He's at work while I'm here.
He won't leave my room.	Will he talk to me?	No.
I'm good, thanks.	What are you on?	Pardon me?
I've been here twenty years.	Maybe that's too long.	Maybe# ?
Oh.	How old are you?	Forty.
Listen# maybe I can get you a year.	I hate this job.	What are you talking about?  You love your job.
Sam?	Uh huh.	I didn't recognize you!
If she's not up, you can use my shower.	Thank you.	You're here early today.
Who are you, anyway?  I don't even know you.	You'll know me by the time we're through.	I'm not going!
I'm not going!	You don't have a choice.	Mom# please.
I don't know.	I'm gonna take a walk.  I need some money.	You'll have money when you work.
No one would blame me if I left!	I'd blame you.  I want you here.	I'm not doing it!
Where are you going?	I don't know.	When are you going to be back?
Where is it?	A friend of yours is here.	Did you got through my pants?
I know the feeling.	How do you become something you're not?	What would you like to be?
I wish you had told me then.	I'm telling you now.	I gave up on you.
I loved him too much.	After everything he did to you and your mom?	After everything.
I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?	The kind where there isn't really an answer.	I still don't know what that means.
I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?	The kind where there isn't really an answer.	I still don't know what that means.
I just wanted to know where Mom was?	Oh.  Sorry.	It's okay.
Lock the door behind you.	Where is he?	Where he always is.
What was I supposed to do?  When you didn't show up Saturday, I tried to call. Your phone isn't working.	I don't have a phone.	I drove over and you were gone.
It makes me sad.	What?	I used to live here.
You brought your kids?	I kind of said that maybe they could do something.  Help.  I'm sorry.  They really wanted to come.  I really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me.  I don't think they'll be too much trouble.	I'll find something that won't kill them.
I know they're not much help, but they love coming here, George.	How much time do they get to spend with their dad?	What is it with this?  They wouldn't spend less time with Peter if they lived here!  He has no time!
Nothing is going on with us, is it?	Going on?	When I picked you up from the train station# what you said.
Let's not do this, okay?	I need to know.	You need to know what?  Do I still love you?
What the fuck?	Everything happens for a reason.  That's what my dad said.	Then you tell me, what just happened?
I'm helping George build his house.	What?	I've been helping for the last few days. Weeks.  Sam's working.  I told you Sam was working.  I mean, he really is.
I can't go right now.	You can't go because of Sam?	We haven't been away together for three years.  What difference does a few months make?
Hey.	Hey.	You got a dog?
Do you know anything about building a house?	No.	I guess I could teach you some things.
What are you doing in my room?	I didn't go in your room.	I locked the door!  Get out!  I locked the door!  Get out!
The door was open.	I don't know what I'm doing.	I wouldn't let Adam or Ryan see you doing it.
You're sure about this?	Yeah.	You could keep it and rent it out?
Adam, that's not true!	Yes, it is.	Would you stop being ridiculous?  Your father wants Sam home as much as I do.
Look, I am truly sorry about this. I'd like to help you# 	But you can't.	At least the kid's getting out. Isn't this what you wanted?
She always said that if you were on the outside# 	But I'm not on the outside. I'm in here.	I know she's sorry she won't be seeing you anymore. Anyway, she wanted me to take care of you.
Forty years. That's a long time for any crime, even murder.	It's a hell of a lot longer when you're innocent.	Half the men in this prison swear they're innocent. Don't you think that's kinda funny?
Don't I know you?	I don't think so.	Sure I do. What's your name again?
What?	Nothing.	No, tell me what's so funny.
I said you're soft.	Hey, man, don't ever call me that.	I call it like I see it, and what I see is definitely soft.
Hey, Ray. I've been looking for you.	Here I am.	Guess we better get going, huh?
I think he's hurt pretty bad.	He's dead.	Oh, man, I've never seen a dead body before!
What do you think you're doing?! The man's been dead for two seconds! Don't you have any respect?	It ain't here.	What ain't there?
Don't mention it.	Hell, you'd probably be half way to New York by now# 	I'm serious, man. Don't mention it. Ever.
I can't do it.	That's because you're soft. Gimme the gun.	What'd you say?
How you doin'?	I'm all right.	You ever done time before?
This town is really going to hell lately.  So what part of the city do you live in?	I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though.	You have a dog? What kind?
Do me.	I love you.	I love you.
Why is that funny?	I don't know.	And sorry, man, but no dogs allowed.
Where do you think we came from?	From? From? From?	We were sent here and you know it. Others have been sent here. Where are they? Hiding?
Do you have anything special in mind?	I don't care#  Just get it over with.	Hurry#  hurry#  hurry.
Let's have sex.  I thought you were curious.	Not about that.	I'm listening.
You could have called me yourself.	But I wasn't sure you'd come.	Here I am.  Shall I come in?
I couldn't get you out of my mind.	I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?	Maybe#  sure# 
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?	You know.	I don't believe you. There has to be more.
Why show me?	I'm going to run.	Why tell me?
What're you going to do?	That's tomorrow.	I wish I could help you.
Are you taking me to them?	Yes.  I don't know what else to do $  with him following us.  Why do you keep running from your $ 	Because he's my friend $   and I don't want to be killed by him $  or anyone.
Do you think everything's going to turn to ice?	I doubt it.	Don't ever let go.
How long have you been living here?	For as long as I can remember.	What kind of place is this?
But there may be a few around somewhere.	What makes you think so?	My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
What's beyond this place $  do you know?	No, no, no	Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?
Are you ready to put him in?	Not yet.	All right.
I know#   We're going to try and get in this way. I don't think you can make it.	Oh#  I did so look forward to seeing all those people.	I'm sorry.
You okay, man?	What?	You okay?#  What's wrong?
We'll keep a watch on the house.	As best we can.	If anything else happens, you'll call us.
What a fuckin' job.	His or ours?	Ours, Ed.
I was here yesterday.	Yeah, I remember.	How would you like to take me to dinner?
I want more.	Me, too.	Can I call you?
Hello.	It's me# 	Hi.
Pete?	Me, too.	I'll call you again.
You like it?	No, honey#  It was part of the deal.	What deal?
So, should I call Andy?	Andy?	That's his name#  Andy. Our ticket out of here.
Set.	Why are ya goin' so early?	'Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby.
Are you my man?	Yes.	Are you gonna be a man about this, Pete?
You all right?	We killed him.	You killed him.
Hey.	Sit down a minute.	What's up?
Never saw him before in my life.	Did you tell the police this?	We're not saying anything about that night to the police. We should all forget that night.
Where's Pete?	Out in back.	You talk to him?
I wouldn't know how.	You say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday?	When he went to work, right.
We've met before, haven't we?	I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?	At your house. Don't you remember?
You don't mind that I'm not coming tonight?	What are you going to do?	I thought I'd stay home and read.
Good book, huh?	Huh?#  oh, yeah, it is.	Same one you were reading the other night?
I had a dream about you last night# 	Yeah?	You were in the house#  calling my name#  but I couldn't find you.
What was that?!!!	What?	On the tape! There was something else on the tape.
Let's go home.	But# 	Now! We're leaving now! I didn't want to come here in the first place.
I told you to stay in the car!	Why? what is it? Why did you make me wait out here?	I thought there might be somebody inside.
Hello.	Hey, Pete#  How ya doin'?	Who is this?
You sure you're doin' okay? Everything all right?	Yeah.	That's good, Pete. Hey#  I want you to talk to a friend of mine.
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?	At your house. Don't you remember?	No. No, I don't.
I missed you.	Yeah?# 	Yeah.
What's happening to you? What happened to your face?	I don't know.	What do you mean?#  You've been acting strange lately#  Like the other night.
What else about that night?#  Did anything happen?	You really don't remember?	No#  I told you.
What do you want?	Nothin'#  You want to go for a drive?	I don't know.
Where'd you come from?	I've been here. You were lookin, right at me.	I was?
All of it?	Yes. Might as well - all of it.	Yes, sir.
Yes, it just shows I don't know why I'm talking to you. I don't know you. Who are you?	Okay, brother.	Don't call me brother.
I say, will you have a cigarette?	No.	Say, you're an American, aren't you?
Hey, what's happened to you?	Nothing. Why?	Why, you look beautiful.
Yes. I'm afraid it does.	Shall we have another?	No thanks. Not tonight if you don't mind.
Please calm yourself. You'll soon be well if you do.	I don't need any advice from you! Get me a doctor!	I'm sorry, but we have no doctors here.
What is it?	See that spot?	Yes.
Look here, Bob, Ever since I can remember, you've looked after me. Now I think you're the one that needs looking after. I'm your brother, Bob. If there's something wrong with you, let me help you.	Oh, George # 	Besides, I - I don't feel like making that trip alone, Bob.
There are so many questions I'd like to ask you, I hardly know where to begin.	I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here. Whether I was born here.	Thank you.
You shot an eight year old girl.	Uh#  yes.  Apparently I did, air.	The hell were you thinking?
Oh, yeah?  Fill us in, why don't you.	What if he's telling the truth?	You know something?  I actually never think of that.  I gotta get some coffee.
He's here to help!?	Yes.  Well, in his own mind, yeah.  What if, from his point of view, he is?	How does that help me?
Found it.	Tell us the truth.  You don't just find these things, at least not in this neighborhood.	I promised I wouldn't tell.
What?	They're inside.	Who?
Drop some money.	Forget that guy $ 	Do it.  Right here.  On the ground.
No.  Follow him.	He'll turn around.	He won't.
I'm sorry, John, but you have to run again.	What $ 	RUN!
$  but he didn't.	Then who was he?	Just some guy#  they found.
Think, John.  Why would they set you up?	Because I found out about her# 	About who?
You don't remember me, do you?	We know each other?	Oh, yes.
I put you away $ 	Yes, you did.	You made those tapes# 
Look at the kid.  In this one, he's on the left of the man in the suit.	Yeah?  So?	Now look at him# 
Go ahead.	Did he close the front door?	What?
Red Ball?	Nope.  Somebody's thinking about this one.	Amazing there's someone within two hundred miles actually dumb enough to still do that.
Why did you catch that?	Because it was going to fall.	You're certain?
She spoke to me.	To you?  I don't think so#   What'd she say?	She said# 
He looks familiar.	Who?	The man across the street.  I've seen him before# 
I don't have any sugar either.	Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?	No.
Since right after we lost our son.	You mean after he lost your son.	It was nobody's fault.
Is he cute?	He's okay.	Should I fuck him?
Go finish getting ready. I'll take care of dinner.	Yeah? You sure?	Go.
I never promised you anything.	How could you let her see this?	Goodbye, Bobby.
Take her.	What'd you say?	I want you to take her with you.
C'mon girl. Eat up.	Get away from her.	Excuse $ 
So what do we do?	We go and hang out with the dude, make him happy, drink some tea, whatever it takes, until he feels comfortable enough to bring it up on his own. We make the drop, go home to California.	Where is this happening?
Yes.	What is it?	You want $ 
Hi. I, uh, think that's us.	Hi. I'm Jimmy.	Bobby.
We need guns.	We don't need guns.	I think we might.
What are you doing?	What are you doing?	I know you're not calling Jimmy.
You happy?	About what?	Why you gotta make everything difficult?
Where do you think you're going?	Back in.	You fucking nuts?
We need guns.	We don't need guns.	I'm pretty sure we do.
Hey, boys.	Tom. How's it going?	Fine, fine. And you were# ?
Where's the surprise?	You want your surprise?	Yeah. I want it.
Yes.	Where do you live?	Excuse me.
See you later.	You really in trouble?	Stop.
No shit?	Does anyone want another?	You want another drink?
I get it.	Tell me.	Don't worry. I get it.
I told you less paper, less trouble.	I'm working on it.	I keep all my numbers in my head. I've never written any down.
Daddy, where's my money?	What you talking?	You owe me six big ones.
That's bullshit. That's a white man's book. Ain't all these white man's books?	They sure ain't no black man's books in here.	Then what you telling me to study in them for?
Yeah. When I was picking a lock to rob somebody's house.	Tell Him that.	I don't know how.
It won't be easy.	Just hold me.	It will be rough.
Why are you looking at me like that?	Because you're in trouble.	How do you know?
I'm gonna try and get some work done tonight.	Let some of us come down there.	No, that won't be necessary. I'll be all right.
I thought you said we were going to the movies last night.	I say a lot of things.	And like a fool I believe it.
I better not come in.	I ain't stupid.	I mean it's late, baby.
It's the same questions, Mrs. Little. Since the death of your husband $ 	Murder.	$  there is a serious question as to whether $ 
[Where are you coming from?]	[South America.]	[Where are you staying in Mexico?]
A lot of people are looking for you.	I guess that makes you the smart one.	We're interested in the same thing. I'm writing a story.
[I don't know, I swear.]	[I believe you.]	[I'm professional. I just do my job.]
[The most important thing in life is family. And there you are. You have my family. What do you want?]	[I want you.]	[This is not possible. But in that house I have money. If I tell you where $ ]
[Yeah.  Yes.]	[Listen! I will give you a life for a life.]	[What do you mean?]
So what's wrong?	Nothing wrong.	Don't give me that bullshit.
What are you doing here?	I came to visit you.	Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit.
No.	You can drive and talk at the same time, can't you?	No.
Do you always sleep with him?	I'm too old for him. Don't tell my friends.	I don't talk to them much. Does he have a name?
You're late.	I'm sorry.	You were never late before, I was worried.
Where's my mother?	I dropped her at home.	It's no wonder you're late. Why didn't she just come with you?
Could I ask you a question?	Could I stop you?	You don't drink like you used to.
Who you gonna call?	I was gonna call that girl from last night. Take her to a movie tonight.	Are you kidding?
Hey, I come home from your house last night, Marty was here with a girl.	Who?	Marty.
No, Marty, please# 	I like you. I like you. I been telling you all night, I like you# 	Marty# 
No# 	Please# 	No# 
I don't like her.	You don't like her. You only met her for two minutes.	Don't bring her to the house no more.
See you.	It's possible	Hang in there.
You're asking for somebody else?	It happens to be a matter of life and death.	A man is going to die if he doesn't have my fair young body?
What's going on? Who started this?	You mean who hit who?	Yes, that's what I mean.
Huh?	Are you all right?	Yeah, I'm all right.
Did you write this?	Yes, I did, John. But I had no idea what was going on.	You didn't?
Hello there. Well, well! If it isn't the man about town!	All set, Ann?	Huh? Oh, yes. Let's go.  Now, let's see. We want some action in these pictures.
Hurry up, Pop.	Oh.	Right here. Sit down.
Colonel!	You shouldn't have gotten out of bed, Miss.	Has he been here?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.	Both of 'em?	Yes, both of 'em! But don't let him out of your sight.
It's for Ann # 	Oh, how nice! Thank you very much.	Flowers.
Tell my dad.	Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him?	Tell my dad I'm sorry about the watch.
I want a plane waiting at the airport. I'll tell them where I want to go when I get there.	Is that all?	For now that's all.
We won!	We lost.	We won.
How long you been coming here?	About six years. My partner took me.	Is it always like this?
What the fuck is going on.	I don't know, but I've got to get on there.	You're crazy.
How many have you lost?	I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it.	And what about the ones you don't save?
Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work.	What do you want from me?	Something I guess I can't have anymore.
I wanted to get this out of the way.	You got a bet on the game tonight?	As a matter of fact, I do.
You like this place?	It's very nice.	I guess you realize that there's something special that I want to talk to you about.
Hmm?	Things have been going pretty well between us, haven't they?	Yeah.
Are these yours?	Yeah, they are but# 	Come on!
There are two million people in there with you.	Yes.	They have nothing to do with this $ 
How come I can't remember?	Because I took it out of your memory.	Why $ 
It's time to wake up.	Wake up?!	From the dream.
But what would happen to me?  I have no body to return to.	Not my problem.	So wrong $ 
You sure he's going to come?	It's his nature.	But what if he doesn't $ 
What's her name?	Who?	The woman you're stuck on.
One condition.	What?	The truth.
Then you had her killed.	Why would I do that?	To hide the evidence.
Why?	It was a test.	For what?
To see how long it would take for me to realize.	Realize?	You weren't real.
I wasn't with you.	I know.	But you were with me.
I'm sorry.	Sorry?!	There was no other choice.
What's so funny?	This.  No point to it.	Why not?
Up here, Boss.	That ain't exactly been the lucky spot lately.	But from now on it's Lucky's spot.
Come on. It's Christmas. At least stay for breakfast.	I'm already late.	For what?
Charlie?	I'm doin' business here!	But there's# 
Sorry, Charlie. I gotta get my Johnson worked tonight.	Jesus.	Hell. It's been four days!
You're fuckin' crazy.	But only on purpose, Tommy.	This is nice. I mean it.
Did we just - hit something?	I don't think so.	Are you okay??
Oh, please, don't hurt me.	I just need to use the phone, lady.	Oh, let me get out of your way then.
Excuse me, sir.  I just wanted to thank you for helping me get into my building yesterday.	Yeah, sure, no problem, you're welcome.	My daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe.  Is that true?
Is there something else I can do for you?	Well, I'd love to see inside your club.	You want to come inside?
So, what do you think?	Well, once you're inside, it's nice.	You don't like where I live?
I think you should consider coming out and staying with me longer.	Oh, I don't want to be in the way. You've got your career and everything.	You wouldn't be in the way.  I like having you around.
Did you like the first act?	Yeah. What about the second act?	That's taking place outside now.
I did. What about it?	Well, Jeff put that out himself.	Himself!
It might save some of the pieces, Jeff. It would leave a doubt about the whole thing$ about you. Might blow over, this way.	Yeah. I see. Well$ that's about the only thing to do. Don't you think?	Well, I guess it's a chance.
Ah! That's more like it! What?	Well$ for a couple of years now$ I$  I've thought it would be a wonderful thing to have a National Boys' Camp out in our State$ 	A camp! Well!
I wouldn't wait if I were you.	What do you mean? What's going on?	The Head Man's writing a Bill.
Are you married?	Yes, sir.	Any children?
No. Are you?	No.	You don't go out with girls very much, do you?
Would you like to walk the rest of the way? It's so nice out.	Yes.	Yeah, let's.
I didn't think you could come with the party and everything.	Oh, I wouldn't let them stop me from seeing you. So I threw them out!	You threw them out!
The reason why I wanted to take a walk, Mary, is 'cause I wanted to talk to you.	Let's just walk, okay?	All right.
Mary, I'm going home.	Are you? When?	In a day or so, I think.
How's it going? Okay?	Yes, quite all right. Thank you, sir.	Gold, eh?
Sit over there, will you?	Me sir?	Yes.
How is this, sir?	Perfect! Perfect!	I wish you luck, sir.
You can't come up here!	Let me go! I wanna see him!	He's not home, I tell you!
I can't find him.	You can't?	I looked everywhere. I even went to his house. It's locked up.
Huh? On, no. Nobody important.	Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you?	Uh-huh.
Nice day out - er, nice night - wasn't it? - isn't it?	Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.	It would be a nice night to go for a walk, don't you think?
What?	Stop now.	Why? I'm paying for this.
Where's your wife, Henry?	Go to hell.	I didn't hear you.
What is it?	It's a thought I had.	Should I open it now?
Yeah#  me you, too#  I was at your house# 	Oh?	Upstairs, with Doc#  Yeah, it's very nice#  I heard your shower.
You're early#  it's not ready. What happened?	My patient had to leave early.	Who was that?
But you know how to drive?	Sure.	Got a license?  But no car?
What's happening here?	We're going for a walk.	Do you think that's a good idea?
What'd you want?	There's something I think we need to talk about.	What?
Finally, some common sense# 	What do you mean?	I think you know what I mean.
Well, look who's here# 	Good evening, Mrs. Cook.	Just who is here, can you tell me?
We'll take it slow. You'll never feel you can't handle it.	I don't think I can afford it. I don't want my dad paying.	We'll work it out.
You're doing great.	I don't know if I'm going to make it the whole way.	It doesn't matter. Go on.
When I was in high school we used to come up here and make out. I liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down.	That's what I like.	Which thing?
# but first, you have to tell me something# 	Anything#  just ask.	What is your name?
You got off easy.	Will you wait for me?	We're only talking about six weeks.
Can I ask you a personal question?	Of course! That's exactly what I want.	Have you thought about getting a wife?
I hope you don't think I want you to do this for free. Just because we're gonna play it like we're friends, doesn't mean I won't pay you like a doctor.	I understand.	I have a lot of money. Do you know how much money I've got?
How's it coming?	You don't think I'm insane?	And that's your secret?  You meant $  like a trade secret?
Damn! What is your name?	Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.	It matters to me.
I've told you a lot of private stuff.	I can tell you anything else.	What about everything? How did this happen?
C'mon, friend.	Why do you like to fight so much?	'Cause I look good doin, it.
The key!? She has the lost key!?	Yes. No one has ever had so much, been so close. We must stop her, or it will be the end of us all.	Then we will kill her, we will kill her and all those with her.
And what is he in prison for?	I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself.	And what did he say?
I will give you one hundred pounds to spare his life.	I would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang.	Two hundred pounds.
Yeah, I was there.	You swear?	Every damn day.
I can't believe I allowed the two of you to get me drunk.	Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there.	Well neither do I, thank you.
He was the last time I saw him.	When was that?	I was eight.
Come here.	I'm not that kind of girl.	Then why are you here?
Hi.	Alone tonight?	Every night.
Leave him alone. She's his mother, not yours.	We had an off night, that's all.	So when are we gonna have an on night?
You know something? Those guys are really starting TO PISS ME OFF!	But there's still only six of us.	SO WHAT?
But she still might call!	Are you coming or not?	I'll drive.
She likes you.	Definitely.	Ask her out.
Where am I going?	Through there!	Right.
I haven't been there for three years.	I haven't been back for ten years. Is your family still there?	No, they're living in Nice now.
My God# !  What time is it?	Four o'clock.	My God, what a fire!
Promise me you will never leave me.	I cannot promise you that.	Promise me.
Yes $  what is it?	Open the door.  It's me.	Go away $  I'm busy.
What you mean talk to her?	You know what he mean, dude.	I'm gone.
Just a little.	I can't taste nothing.	What's the matter with your girlfriend?
You go first.	Naw, you go first.	You go first.
You want us to give you a ride?	I don't know.	What you mean, you don't know?  Just wait here.
I did.  Is that door locked?	It's locked.	Make sure.
Hey, guys, I'm outta here.	Thanks for the help.	Hey, man, the pleasure's all mine. Thanks for the dog, and the money.  Maybe my dad won't kick my ass tonight.
Ah damn.  Damn.	I got fired too.	What?!
Hey, what's going on?	Nothing.  What you want?	Are you going to take me to see Mom?
You were saying?  Your daughter# .?	I# 	Yes?
You shot her?	No.	Who did?
You're out of your mind.	What's your point?	I will do no such thing.
What# ?	Tell me why I miss him.	He's dead?
Are you sure?	I've heard this speech a lot. Come on. We'll take care of him.  We will.	But# 
Haven't you ever seen anybody kiss like that?	On TV.	You never saw your Mom and me kiss like that?
So, come on. You never saw us kiss like that?	No way.	How did you see us kiss?
Can we go now?	Not just yet, baby. There's# there's something Daddy has to do.	To be a hero?
No, honey, not to be a hero. But I want you to remember something for me, all right?	All right.	He's doing it for you. No matter what anybody tells you, no matter who they are, he's doing it for you, because he loves you.
You said there was only one person you knew wasn't in on this thing.	Yeah.	You're going to go see her.
Well?	I don't know.	What are you going to do now?
Well, is it real? Do we know anything about it?	It looks real. I don't know anything about guns.	Could I see it?
Hey, would you look at this crazy car? Everybody has their own radio. What do you think of that?	Everybody does?	Yep. And you can listen to it without anybody else listening. Let's try it out.
That's pretty good.	I've done much better ones than this.	You have, huh?
I'm not a baby.	You're a big girl, huh?	I'm not a big girl but I'm not a baby.
Close your eyes.	Why?	I've got something for you.
You got this under control?	Yeah.	It doesn't look like it.
I'm looking for them.	Where?	Right there.
Come Back.	Yeah.	Put her on.
He never told about the money.	No.	What do you figure he done with it?
Ben, I'm a Man of God.	Tryin' to make me talk about it in my sleep!	No, Ben.
And the Lord told that man $ 	Yes! Yes!	The Lord said, Take that money and throw it in the River!
John, where's your folks?	Dead.	Dead. 
All right#   Come along.	What?	Go ahead of me $  the both of you.
What do you want?	Them kids!	What are you after them for?
Bring him out of what?	My dream.	How you plan to do that?
You okay?	Great	To bed with you, c'mon.
You okay?	Yeah. Just had a little dream. I'm falling right back to sleep.	Okay#  You need anything, just call.
Your old man thinks I did it, don't he?	He doesn't know you.  Couldn't you change?	The cops were all over my house.  They'll kill me for sure.
No.	Well then how can you say somebody else was there?	Because somebody cut her. While I watched.
What the hell you doing here?	Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?	Of course. What's that?
No, I left everything in Paris. I just happened to be wearing this.	Tell me#  what else did you have?	Well, a hat# 
You, please.	Me?	Yes. Could you give me some information?
Can I help you?	You might hold this for me.	Love to.
I suppose you don't think that's funny?	No.	It seemed funny to me when I first heard it. Maybe the trouble isn't with the joke. Maybe it's with you!
Not funny, huh?	No.	So you don't think that's funny? It is funny! Everyone else thinks so! Maybe you didn't get it.
It's nine o'clock.	That's when one half of Paris says to the other half, "What are your plans for this evening, madame?"	Well, first I should like to take off my hat and jacket.  Then could we have some music?
Are we going to build our little house?	Yes#  a little white house.	Not white, darling.
What shall we get? The news!	No, no news. We don't want to know what's happening in the world. We want to be left alone, don't we?	Yes, sweetheart#  all by ourselves.
This way, madame. Are you alone? By the window perhaps?  Or a nice little corner table?	This will do. 	I think this is the first time you have been to my little place. Your face is new to me. Now, what shall it be?
Bring me something simple. I never think about food.	But, madame! If you don't think about food what do you think about?	The future of the common people.
How much do you need?	Uh, I would say these people are going to cost a million dollars over the next two years # 	We could get that.
What'd he say?	What do you think?  He said in life there's no free ride.	What'd you say?
Hey #  you'll be able to do it now.	What #  ?	Go to law school.  Mom and Dad'll be able to afford it now # 
I was asleep, Mr. President.  What can I get you?	Just #  uh #  you know.	Of course.
#  Somebody should shoot the little bastard.	I wanna fight just as dirty as he does.	#  Use his women.
We lost # 	I know # 	It's hard to lose # 
I'll do it.  No more.	Are you serious?	Yeah #  I'm out.
It was our dream, too, Buddy, together #  always.	Do you really want this, Dick?	This.  Above all.
Hi, Buddy.  What are you doing in here?	I've missed you.	Are you okay?
Yes.	When?	Tomorrow.
Why didn't you?	You can't expect me to explain that to you.	What matters to me is whether you understand it.
It'll be over soon.	No #  it's just going to start now #   If I could just #  If I could just #  sleep.	There'll be time for that.
How'd you know I was here.	Who else'd be in your truck.	You heard it?
# I always thought when I got older God would sort of come into my life in some way. He didn't. I don't blame him. If I was him I'd have the same opinion about me that he does.	You don't know what he thinks.	Yes I do.
Don't know why I did. I told you, I don't know where he is.	You ain't heard from him?	No I ain't.
Probably must be.	So when was he here?	I don't know. Oh.
# Be careful.	I always am.	Don't get hurt.
# How'd you sleep?	I don't know. Had dreams.	Well you got time for 'em now. Anything interesting?
No.	I ain't got the money.	No.
# You got no cause to hurt me.	No. But I gave my word.	You gave your word?
Do you have any idea how goddamn crazy you are?	You mean the nature of this conversation?	I mean the nature of you.
# You need to talk to me.	I don't need to talk to you.	I think that you do. Do you know where I'm going?
# I know where you are.	Yeah? Where am I?	You're in the hospital across the river. But that's not where I'm going. Do you know where I'm going?
Is somethin' wrong?	With what?	With anything?
You don't know what you're talking about, do you?	Sir?	I said you don't know what you're talking about.
Well#  I need to close now $ 	You live in that house behind the store?	Yes I do.
Call it.	Call it?	Yes.
Look#  I got to know what I stand to win.	Everything.	How's that?
Good. I need everything else.	Okay.	You get a lot of people come in here with no clothes on?
Don't stop. Just ride me up past the rooms.	What room?	Just drive me around. I want to see if someone's here.
Could I get another room.	You want to change rooms?	No, I want to keep my room, and get another one.
Hey, Sheriff. How's everything?	Oh, you know, the usual#  keeping the world safe.	# I meant your food.
What the hell do you want?#  Hey, Sue Ann, what's up?	We think we know where Betty is.	Ah, shit#  Do I have to hear this now?
Do you know who I am?	# I#  I know what you are.	Do you know why I'm here?
That's my son! My son is dead!	I'm sorry.	You're sorry? YOU'RE THE REASON WE'RE HERE!
It's all right.	You sure? Maybe next week we could# 	Uh-huh. No, we'll do it later. 'S only a birthday, right? I'll have another one next year# 
Were you with him this whole time?	Oh, God! You scared me! Yes# 	You still in love?
Does he know you think he's real?	He is real.	Uh-huh#  So, what'd you talk about?
What?! That you had something to do with it?	I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't# 	Yeah, but your running away isn't going to help you with all this# 
He's telling the truth. He doesn't know.	Should I kill him now?	Wait. Any last words, General Lee?
They said find it. Find her, find it. Finish the job you were paid to do.	Half.	What?
We should go.	We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one's got to be her.	It's a very moving experience, trust me.
Well, guess what? I found Betty#  where she's been, anyway.	Where? Where is she?	I'm not telling.
# and how long did she work here?	Oh, five years, give or take.	Hmm#  you two in high school together?
Betty, I thought this would be the best way. You know, throw you into it# 	What the hell's going on?	If you need a minute, that's okay. But I thought you'd want to $ 
You've got to be missing a piece of your soul to kill someone. That's not our Betty# 	# why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?	Because it ain't natural, young man.
Come back here, kid!	What for?	Okay, okay. You win.
That's not how she told it. She said you wrote her every week you were away.	I wrote. Not every week# 	She said you told her in every letter how much you loved her, how you wanted to marry her, have children with her# 
What did you call me?	Pardon?	What did you call me, boy?
I hear most of the girls who come to these things are looking for a husband.	Not me.	Yeah? Why're you here?
I shouldn't have done that. I should've walked.	He didn't give you much choice.	There's always a choice.
Hi.	Are those for me?	No, they're for your mom.
I'd like to come with you.	Why?	Because he's my friend, too.
What the fuck is funny about this?	God.	There is not one thing funny here.
What?  What do you want me to do?	What do you think?  Get us into that room.	I can't.
Fuck!	Keep your voice down.	They're not supposed to be here!
Got her right where you want her, Junior.	Shut up.	When you said you'd let 'em go I thought she'd come running right out for sure.
She's never coming out.	Hey.	And we're never getting in.
You walk out that door and you lose your share of the money.	Yeah, whatever.	I mean it!
Yeah?	Everything okay?	Huh?
Somebody called you?	Can we come in?	What do you want?
Can we come in?	Stop asking me that.  I'm fine.  Who called you?	You don't look so good.
Cut it back a little bit.	No fucking way.	He's right, we can't get into the room if they're dead!
Something's weird.	What?	I don't know, doesn't that corner seem funny to you?
Fuck him.	Don't.	Fuck her too.
He's going down.	That room!	What?!
Can't hear a thing.	What do they want?	I don't know.  Rob us.  I don't know.
What do we do?	Wait.	What if they get in here?
Why did the chicken cross the road?	What am I, a five year old?	Why did the chicken cross the road?
If it looks like I can't get back, just close the door.	No.	Close it!
He'll do something.	Uh uh.	He'll know we're in trouble.  He heard me, I said "There are three# "
I'm sorry.	I'm sorry.	Why?
Get out of the car.	What's with you?	Get out of the fucking car.
Check it out#  Great huh? I tell you those guys know what time it is. Man I'm with that# 	I don't know. Look around man.	C'mon Judge we got to start somewhere.
What's up with you?	Nothing.	You got something on your mind#  "brother."
Excuse me?	I said, I'm not my sister.	I know that.
Father, there's something else I need to talk to you about.	What?	Come with me.  I'll tell you when we get there.
It was a different time, son.  And you're a better man than that.	I see, do as I say, not as I do.	Yes.
There are some letters here from him.  Some are just to you.	I don't care.  I hate him.	You don't hate him.
Put those away.	But father, they might come this way.	Put them away.
Father#  I killed those men# 	Don't blame yourself, you did what I told you to do.	I'm glad I killed them#  I'm glad# 
What if you can't read what's written on there anymore?	Well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it?	Yes$ 
Is he really all right?	Yes.	Because you promised.
I don't get it.	Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow?	Yeah, sure.
I'm not tired!	I'm sure you're not.	Then why do I have to go to bed?
You need a glass?	Not at all.	Good for you.
Almost there, Louis.	You keep saying that.	This time I mean it.
Well, she was a little upset at first, and that's why I thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to your people last night# you did, didn't you, Louis?	Yes.	Why, then, things should be fine.
What's in your head, boy?	She.  Goes.  Free.	You've got one shot $  and we can't die.
Who makes all these?	I do.  And I practice with them. At least three hours a day.	You need to find yourself a girl.  Or maybe the reason you practice three hours a day is you've found one $  but can't get her?
Move away.	No.	Move!
I think he's telling the truth.	He's not telling the truth.	He may be.
Did you feel that?	Did I?  I've been waiting for that for years.	Not that.
Hey!	You don't want this.	Yeah, I do!
I bet he hasn't read a single report we've written on the waste problem.	I hope you're right.  I'd feel a lot worse if he had read them and just didn't care.	What are you going to do?
When did you# ?	Been out for six months now.	Really?  What have you been doing?
What's that supposed to mean?	Just giving credit where credit is due.	You have no one to blame but yourself.
I don't believe it.  You're here! Oh thank God.	You didn't think I could just leave you?	I didn't know what was going to happen.  I was just so worried something was going to happen to you.
Will - uh - five thousand be enough?	For what?	For the letters, of course.
I'm not going!	What are you talking about?	I'm talking about - I'm not going out.
Look, I quit!	Yeah?	Yeah.
All right, outside!	I beg your pardon, sir?	Outside!
Indeed? Perhaps he will do me a great favor.	With pleasure, Madame!	Get out of here.
What?	It doesn't matter.	No. I want to know.
You sure you want to know this?	Yes.	Okay.
Yes #   It's just that # 	What?	Well #   #  Your father would never do anything like that.
Does it look okay?	Looks just like it did.	And they won't be able to tell?
I'm so proud of you, Bud.	Thanks #  I love you.	I love you too.
Oh, hi # 	I'm sorry # 	No, no #  Come on in.
Where'd you get this?	Bud brought it to me.	Bud?
What?	She's crying.	No she's not.
Wait # 	I've got to go # 	It's alright.
You can't go out there.	But I really should get home.	But you can't go out there.
I told you where I was.	All night?	I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.
Look. Let's just forget about it. Let's just go to the meeting and # 	I told you, George. I'm not going.	Sure you are.
Look at me George. That meeting's not for me. Look at my face.	It's fine. You'll put on some make up and # 	I don't want to put on some make up # 
Don't! Just let go.	It's better, Mary Sue.	I said, NO!  #  I've read like one book in my whole life and I'll be damned if I let you throw it on that fire # 
What I mean is #  Mary Sue's been a little "different" lately # 	She won't go out with me?	I didn't say that. It's just that right now # 
Are you alright?  What is it?	Rain.	Real rain?
How'd you know about the fire?	What?	How'd you know how to put it out and all?
God, David. Just give it to me!	Get lost!	YOU get lost!
Oh my God.	What happened?	I'm not sure.
Oh God.	What's going to happen?	I don't know #  It's not possible #   Is it possible?
I still don't see why we're doing this.	We're supposed to be in school.	We're supposed to be at home David! We're supposed to be in color!  Oh God # 
You have no right to do this.	Well if I don't who will?	They're happy like this.
What's wrong?	Nothing.	Nothing?
So what is it?	Well #  I just #   Can I ask you a question?	Sure.
Can I ask you a question?	Yes.	How come I'm still in black and white?
Hi.	Oh #  Hi.	Look, I probably shouldn't be asking you this$ not knowing you that well and all # 
So what's it like?	What?	Out there.
What's going on?	Rain.	Real rain?
I want a word with you # 	Oh$ well # 	NOW!
OKAY. NOW YOU'RE REALLY STARTING TO PISS ME OFF!	I didn't do anything wrong.	Oh no? Let me show you something!
How long do you think you've been here?	I don't know #  Three, four weeks.	Much less than that.  An hour and a half.
Bud?	Sorry #  I had to help my folks and then I couldn't find my hat # 	Oh.
Oh hi!	Hi there. You took off so quick. I wasn't sure if you were okay.	Oh, yeah. Sorry. I'm fine. I just #  Had to get home early.
Well don't you?	I think you should try not to think about this anymore.	Really?
Oh, hi.	Hi.	Aren't you a little early?
What's wrong?	I'll never be able to do that.	Oh, well$ you're just starting out. I mean, you can't do it # 
So uh #  Maybe we could uh # 	Cool.	Cool.
Did you think that we'd all be looking at you?	No, no, no.	Well it's just not true. We wouldn't be looking at you $  why are you wearing this suit? Did you say hello to your brother in law's?
You're lucky. She couldn't come anyway $ 	Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.	She couldn't come I said. Are you nervous?
It's not cool?	It's fine, but $ 	$  do you think you'll ask her out?
Hello, this is Back.	Hi, is this Jack?	Yes.
Hello?	Hey. What are you doing? How are you?	I'm fine. Who is this?
So you think you can?	No. I'm sorry.	Should I call back and talk to your girlfriend?
Come on, I thought we had fun, rich boy $ 	This is not cool.	It was cool last night.
Is it ok if I leave my car you think?	I don't know.	I thought they opened at seven.  If I left my car would it be ok?
Hi.	Hi.	Do you remember me, I left my car, yesterday.
Business is good, you're busy?	Yeah, not really.	I saw a picture of you.
I'm going to go and eat tomorrow night do you want to go with me?	Sure.	Do you want to pick me up?
That's very nice. Thank you. Thank you for saying that.  You're friends with my sister?	Yeah.	How long have you known her?
Is everything ok?	Yes.	What happened?
There's a better place for us to eat.	Did something happen; are you alright?	Yes I'm fine. Everything is ok. It's fine. Everything is fine.
That was good.	Yeah.	I'll see you later.
You got me out of my hotel room. You came and got me out of my room.	Yeah# # yeah# ..	It's so nice.
Where do you have to go?	For what?	For work# ..
I forgot about that.	Can I come home with you when we get there?	Yeah.
Are you ok?	I'm fine are you ok?	Yes I'm sorry.
Yeah.	Did you do it?	No.
Can we agree that that is that?	That's that.	Thank you.
Yeah.	That was weird. I meant good.	Maybe you said that because you're hungry# ..
What's up?	I think I got in trouble. A little bit of trouble# .	What happened?
Hey.	Hi.	I need to talk to you for a second.
That's cool.	When can you leave?	As soon as you want.
I'll go pay for my car.	Are you sure?	Yeah.
I can't find that thing in my car, I can't find it so I'll just get it and give it to you later. So?	You ready?	Are you coming to eat with us?
Go back to your room. Quickly.	What? What've I done?	Don't come back, not tonight, not again $ 
If you won't read it to your own Mama, then perhaps you ought not to be reading it at all.	It's not your cup of tea, Mama.	Come now, darling, give it a read.
Listen, you come down and stay with us for a few days. Just tell the old man that$ 	I can't	Sure you can, just$ 
He lied to me	He looked into my face and told me it wasn't about you.	And how do you feel when you are lied to?
So, who is he? We have to know him.	Everyone sees someone different. That's what we show.	How?
I want you back	Fuck you.  You wanted me out. I'm out.	I'm sorry.
How 'bout a real drink?	We done?	Yeah.
Oh, no$ 	Yes!	He's Christ?
This looks done.	It's not done.	It looks done. I'll take it the way it is.
Nah, she would never# 	Didn't you just see her lookin' at him? She told me no, but I don't believe her.	C'mon, Jake. You know she's crazy about you.
It ain't worth it, Jake. Get out.	What time is it?	Nine o'clock.
You don't talk very much.	I ain't ever talked to a movie star before.	I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.
Can you see it?	No.	What does that mean?
Are you sure we should be doing this?	Come over here.	You said never to touch you before a fight.
Take off my pants.	Jake# 	Do what I say.
What're you lookin' at? You lookin' at him?	No, I'm not. I'm looking at you.	Don't tell me "No." I saw you lookin' at him. Why, you like him?
Hey, you don't say goodbye to him like that.	What did I do?	You don't kiss like that. Hello and goodbye, that's all you do.
But Jake#  I didn't say anything# 	Don't ever do that again. You don't  do it!	Jake# 
Where you been all day?	I took the kids to my sister's.	I called. You weren't there.
Jake, why don't you just try lying down and get some rest.	I don't know what it is. I dunno, it's the kind of thing that $  the words won't come out.	Jake $ 
I miss Joey. I wish Joey was here.	Why don't you just call him?	I dunno.
Can you get me that ring back?	No.	Tell her to bring it back!
The only honest thing to do is call it off. Let her look for somebody else.	I can just hear you now. "Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!"	That's the hard part.
What's she trying to do? Why doesn't she turn him in?	Smart girl.	Smart? She'll be arrested!
Don't you ever have any problems?	I have one now.	So do I.
I wonder where he's going now?	I don't know.	Suppose he doesn't come back again?
You know something?	What?	You watch too much television.
Meaning me?	What?	Chicken?
Tell him why we moved here.	Hold it, Jim.	You can't protect me.
Blood.	How'd that happen!  What kind of trouble you in?	The kind we've been talking about. Can you answer me now?
Except yourself!	Will you wait a minute?	You don't want me to go.
Whoa!  Whoa!  I know you're a little upset but$ 	Sorry.	What about you, Jim?  Got anything to say for yourself?
I guess I cut pretty loose in my day too.	Really, Frank?  When was that?	Listen$ can't you wait till we get home?
Hi.	Hi there.	You remember me?
Boy!	What?	Once you been up there, you know you been some place!
Listen, I told you not to fool with them.  Now they're waiting for you.	I know.  That's why I came back.	You scared?
I got to go in.  You better get home too.  Hey$ what?	Why don't you come home with me?  I mean nobody's home at my house$ and I'm not tired, are you?  I don't have many$ people I can talk to.	Who has?
Jim!	Who's that!	It's me!
I came here before.	When was that?	When I was here?  When I ran away. I used to run away a lot but they always took me back.
Who's that?	Just a guard.	I shot at one of them.
What about the other boys$ Do you think they'll go to the police?	What's that got to do with it?	Why should you be the only one.
He called me chicken.	And your folks didn't understand?	They never do.
I'll bet you're a real yo yo.	A what?	Goodbye!  See you!
Ever been in a place like this before?	Not exactly.  It's certainly huge.	How many rooms do you think there are?
No!	We have to go back!	No!  I got to find him.
After he tried to shoot you?	He didn't mean it$ we shouldn't have left him.  He needed us.	He needed you, maybe.  So do I.
Is he your friend?	Yes.  My best friend.	What's he like?
I can't take watching you touch him. I can't take his hands on you.	One more day, baby. One more day to Christmas.	I've been doing good, though.
You motherfucker.	Nick, no $ 	You sold him out.
Then they do need me, don't they. They really need me# 	We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this# 	We? What "we"# 
We get to the bridge, we're all right!	Nick, the ice is $ 	Get to the bridge!  HEY! HEY! DOWN HERE!
You saved my life.  You could have run, but you didn't. You saved me.	You saved me.	I saved you because I love you, Nick.  Why'd you save me?
I'm sorry, Nick#  I'm so sorry# 	Don't say my name# 	I love you, Nick# 
I saved your life.	You shouldn't have.	He did love you, you know. Nick. He did love you.
You#  you don't know me $ 	Oh, I know you, Nick. I know you real well.	No, you can't $ 
Who are you now.	You got the wrong guy! She thinks I'm Nick, I'm not!	Put him in the truck.
Where's she work?	What?	Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? Where's she work?
They won't recognize me.	Why not.	Trust me. They won't recognize me.
What's the first thing, man? What's the first thing you're gonna do?	Haven't thought about it.	Hell you haven't.
NO!!!	# for Christmas# 	NICK!!!
That was my card, pop! My card! You hit for my card!	I#  sorry, Mister# 	That was my king!
Daddy, did ya see that?	What?	Guy got me on the ground, tried to fuck me.
Let's go over it. Where are you?	I stand outside and guard the door. I don't let anybody come in or go out.	Mr. Brown?
Follow you where?	Down to my car.	Why?
Gun shot.	Oh that's just fucking great! Where's Brown?	Dead.
So, is he dead or what?	He ain't dead.	So what is it?
Tell them to come on in.	But I'm going to have to leave 'em here. They're $ - well they're not the sort of people you're used to.	It doesn't matter who they are.
There's a nice boy.	Yeah.	That why you always took him on the other side of the street?
I'm sorry, but that's how it's got to be.	I suppose it is.	And it's not only because the trip's a tough one $ 
Why did you change your mind about bringing us along?	Why do you think?	I don't know. I thought I did. Now I'm not sure. I thought it had something to do with me.
Tell me, darling.	What?	What does a man usually tell a girl?
I can't $ 	You've got to $  don't you understand $  they want me with them and they'll fix it so I have to go $ 	No they won't.
You know what she asked me?	I don't care what she asked you.	She told me not to fight with you anymore. She said it wasn't your fault, but $  I figure different# 
She mustn't $  don't you let her $ 	There, there. Don't you upset yourself $ 	If she says anything to them I'll kill her.
I tried my best, but these things take time.	And we're running out of that.	There's still tomorrow morning.
How do you know who we are?	Everybody knows $ 	Who brought you here?
Would you like to learn them?	I sure would.	Maybe I could start you out.
Are you okay?	Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all.	That's always tough. How long were you together?
But, hey, maybe we can be friends.	Sure, that would be cool. Friends.	Okay. See you later, friend.
What should we get?	I don't care. You pick.	Hot dogs.
Okay, I get the point.	So, whatever happened to her?	She killed herself a week before he died.
I'm sorry, I should have been watching where I# 	It's okay.	Oh, my God, Ray! What are you doing here?
Father!	My child, you're alive!	Yes, we made it!
Oh, my God. It happened right here. She came home. She saw them.	Saw who?!	Don't touch me!!
I can do it myself.	Yeah, I can see that. Later I want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do.	The keys. She took the keys.
Oh shit, you gonna take that?	What?	What she said about your mother?
"Ray!"	"Fucked me."	"Ray!"
I don't like this.	Which room is it?	It's the last door at the end of this hall.
You scared?	Yes.	Let's get out of here.
We can't stand here all night.	You could go and open the door.	Listen 
How much does she want?	She could use a hundred dollars.	I'll give you a check.
What did she want?	I did her hair.	What were you talking about?
This is about another murder  a woman at Fifty Second Street	But you do believe me?	The important thing is, the police won't believe you.
What was she to you?	I don't think that you would understand if I told you.	I think I understand without your telling me. I know something of your history, Jason. I know that you haven't written for ten years.
Do you have other things?	Yes.  Oh, you mean to bring in! No. Yes, I have some other things, no, I don't need to bring them in. This is all I need to stay here.	Oh.
Have you ever been on television?	Television?	Yes.
Would you mind?	No.	Okay, I will!!
Yeah, I know. I mean, I'm not saying I know people think you're a bitch, I'm saying I know what you mean. And I don't even know that people think you're a bitch. Do they?	I feel like they do.	Hmm. Well, maybe you are. Really, I wouldn't pay much attention.
So what about kids?	Kids? What about them?	Do you want them?
Hi!	Ann. Hello.	Are you in the middle of something?
Do you talk to him?	When we're making love?	Yes.
If you were in love with me, would you?	I'm not in love with you.	But if you were?
I can't.	Why not?	I've told you.
Don't do that.	Why not?	Because.
Then maybe I saw an old message. There are a lot of them on my desk, you know.	Who'd you have lunch with?	I ate by myself.
I don't#  he doesn't want you to come over.	What do you mean he doesn't want me to come over? Did you tell him about me?	No, I didn't.
In front of him, Ann, yes.	You are in trouble.	Listen to you!! You sound like Mom. What are you talking about?
Here it is.	What is it?	It's a sun dress.
John doesn't have sex with Ann anymore.	Is that what he tells you?	He doesn't have to tell me.
Look, I'm just going to come right out and tell you why I'm here, okay?	Okay.	I'd like to make another tape.
No.	No? Not even one more?	I never do more than one. I'm sorry.
Can I call you at the office?	What do you want to call me at the office for?	I don't know. I just thought I might want to call you. I don't know.
That's us.	I don't want to get up there.	We've got to, Brad, everyone's watching.
Oh my poor baby.	Oh.  Mom.  It's Brad.	I know.
I NEED SOME	YOUNG BLOOD	I NEED SOME
How you doin' tonight, beautiful?	Good. How're you?	Great. You look great.  You both do.
Whoa, why are we getting off?	I've just got to make one quick stop. Won't take a second.	What?
Fuck, man. Too early in the morning for that, you know what I mean?	She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore.	That's your problem, Miles.
That's what you do with every one.	When do we get to drink it?	Now.
You should call her.	I will.  See ya!	Right now.
Hey, there you are.	Yep.	What're you drinking?
Besides what?	Well#  I don't know, just#  the wedding.	What?
What about your agent? Hear anything yet?	Nope.	What do you think's going on?
We're on.	What's happening?	We're going to have some fun. Remember fun? We're going to have some of it. Okay?
You know what I'm thinking?	What's that?	I'm thinking it's time to settle down. One woman. One house. You know. It's time.
She tell you she was married?	Yeah.	So what the fuck were you thinking?
So what's the plan?	The plan is#  you go.	Me?
Come on, let me drive.	I'm fine. You rest.	I feel like driving.
What the fuck!	You said it looked like a car accident.	What the fuck!
Look at this!	I don't know. Doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one.	Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.
So how's that book of yours going, Miles? I think you were almost done with it last time we talked.	I finished it.	Good for you.
Hi.	Hey.	She got anything good?
Sir, what are you doing?	I told you I need a drink.	Then buy a bottle and go outside.
It makes me feel better.	Does she ever answer back?	No.
Does it hurt?	I don't feel much.	Good.
I don't think so.	Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.	No.
I gotta get to my brother. If they came after me, they'll want him too.	You'll never make it.	Have to.
I'll go. I'll bring Jake out here.	Be careful. You're in it now. And it's gonna get mean.	So far that's all I seen in this life.
I'm surprised to see you out here tonight.	I just came out to say goodbye.	Goodbye?
Maybe I ought to throw you in jail too. Then you could be with all your friends.	I haven't done anything.	I want you out of town before the hanging.
You'll have to deal me out on that. I've had some experience with that sort of thing, and I don't want any more.	I understand.	It's not going to be easy.
Then I guess this is where we part ways. Sorry.	No hard feelings.	C'mon, I'll buy you a drink.
Didn't he tell you about Blind Pete?	We didn't get that far.	Blind Pete taught me a great trick.
This a friend of yours?	He is now.	Who is he?
What are you talking about?	I'm done talking. Get out.	You can't do this.
He was murdered.	Who did it?	I'm not sure, but I got an idea. And when I am sure, they're going to pay.
He must be pretty good.	He's good, all right. Too good for my men. That's why you've got to take care of it.	What about his brother?
I'm going to have to look into this.	Yeah, maybe I will too.	I thought we talked about that.
What's this?	That's the good stuff.	Oh, yeah? How good?
What makes you say that?	If he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening.	You sure? Maybe that's the kind of friend I am.
How about you?	I don't want you to get hurt.	He can't hurt me if he's dead.
Where is she?	Good to see you too, Elaine.	Why isn't she with you?
Sorry I didn't get her back in time.	No problem.  Do you want to come in?	Why not?
Maybe you're right.  Twelve years after your daughter's born you decide to become a father.	Better late than never.	I should fire you more often.  The film's looking wonderful.
She was there.  She didn't by any chance happen to mention me?	She said you were very beautiful.	Really?
No, I'm okay.	Let's talk about the work that you care so much about.	Sure.  Where would you like to start?
You have to see her.	I've seen them all before.	Not like this $ 
You love her, don't you, Max?	Don't you?	This should take care of Mother.
It's a hotel.	I don't understand.	Could they have built that hotel since yesterday?
You know you're really very good. I take back what I said.  I mean, you're really good.	Thank you.	You could play the lead.
You ever tell her about how it is with Tommy?	I don't tell her a thing.	Why?
What'd you write?	Words.	What kind of words?
Can I ask you then?	Yes.	What do you want more than anything?
I have to.	When?	Soon. One week.
You didn't take it before. You didn't take it the time after that. And now, you didn't take it again?	Don't get mad.	So who moved it?
You know that accident up there?	Yeah.	Someone got hurt.
I don't like people looking at me like that.	Like what?	Stop it!
Hi.	# Hi.	# You any good with those?
My father and I don't exactly see eye to eye.	About what?	Name something.
Carl.	CARL??? Carl did this?!!	Last night#  he tried to get it on with me.
What are you doing?!	We can't make it. Just get away, when you get the chance.	What?
Can I ask you something?	Shoot.	What do you want to be when you grow up?
Yeah, shit $  hell, you're right. I'm sorry.	You shot me and murdered my friends.	I did. We $  yeah, I know.
What'd you say?	I said I got his machine.	No, what did you say on the machine?
Do you want me to say I did it?	I was kinda hoping, yeah.	Do you want me to say I'm sorry?
I can't discuss $ 	$  You can and you will.	You're finished.
They shouldn't let people like you into space.	Just so you know: I'm not going back until I understand what it is.  I am going to figure out what it is, make it stop, and then I will go home.	Listen $ 
She'll come back.	No, she won't.	Why would you let her to do that?
How much sleep do you need?	How much sleep?	How long can you go without sleep?
What will you say?	To who?	What are you going to report back to Earth?
She knows everything.  She knows who she is.	She knows everything?  Does she know she came once before and you put her in $ 	No.
When did this happen?	Oh, right away.  That's why you never saw me with anyone.  You should've noticed that.  I miss him, though. I think I made a mistake.	Jesus# 
Don't.	Why?	I don't know.  I can't be alone.
You're better when you take them.	I know, I know.  But still, somehow I don't feel better.	All right.  How about I feel better when you take them?
What happened?	You were trying to break down the door.  Do you know why?	When I saw you were gone I got scared.
Do you have any idea how much I like fucking you?	I think so.	Good.  Because I want you to know. I really like fucking you.
Do I really feel like#  I am# ?	Yes.  Yes.	I'm glad.
What's wrong.	You don't love me.	Stop.
Can you sleep?	I don't think do.  It's not sleep; it's something else.  It's all around me.	Those are dreams.
Do you want to stay here?	Do you?	If you're here.
What's happening to us?	It's all right.	Please don't lie.  I told you before, I don't know how I came to be here. Whatever you think you can't say to me, I need to hear you say it.
What do I have to do to stop it?	I want you here.	You're lying.
He won't do it.	Why do you say that?	He won't.
Hi.	I'm sorry.  I'm not sure how this works.  I have to go out#  is that all right?	Uh# 
You all right?	Yeah.	I'm sorry about what happened.
You put me life in danger.	No, you'll be safe.  We're gonna pick him up again# 	And then what?  I'll never be safe. I'll have to leave the country!  You can't protect me, and you can't keep him in jail!  And you knew that all the goddamn time!
Stop, will you?!	Let go!	Stop being nuts!
Yeah.	They called here after you left# 	She's okay.  Everything's okay# 
You told her?	Not exactly.	What do you want to do?
What a memory.	Do you dance?	Do you?
How long you going away for?	Long enough.	"For"# ?
You still going away?	I don't know# 	You don't have to, now.
Mike?	What?	My ass if falling.
Coming to bed?	Few minutes.  Want to catch the news.	Should I wait up?  We've got to get up early for the beach tomorrow.
Mike, take it easy# 	Take it easy!  I set her up.  I saw it coming.	It's not your fault.  Mike, please get off the case.
What did you do tonight?	I watched TV.	What did you watch?
I'm going to visit my sister for a few days.  I'd like you to get your stuff out.	What about Tommy?	He'll live through it.  They all live through it.  What a world, huh?
Are you in charge here?	No, sir# 	I asked for the man in charge# 
You're not going to talk to anyone without a lawyer.	She's not a suspect, sir, she's a witness.  Could I ask you to step outside, please.	No, I will not step outside.
How do I know that's her?	I'll bring her in.  You let them go, and I'll bring her in.	Why should she come in?
How are things going, pal?	Okay, I guess.	How about dinner tonight?
Here you go, Pete.	Uh, Uncle Ben, I$ 	What, want a glass?
I was there.	See?	Or was it all a dream?
Eh.  Week from tomorrow.	How about tomorrow?	You're making my life difficult.
Maybe I was hiding.  For years, I never told Ben the one important thing.	He knew.	Some things you should say anyway.
What are you doing this weekend?	I've gotta study.	Oh. Maybe I should, too$ 
$  but at least Aunt May's okay now. I really have to stop by the hospital this afternoon.	Do you mind if I come too?	I think I'd like that.
It's Friday night# 	Yes.  Do you have a date?	No.
You killed them, huh? Both of them?	Such nice boys! It makes me sick to $ 	Don't wear it out!
Yeah?	Give this to Joey, will you?	Oh.
I know you#  Do I not?	Yes. And I know you.	My father says you have been my friend#  You came back for me.
Yes, yes, Spock# 	The ship#  Out of danger# ?	You saved the ship, Spock. You saved us all. Don't you remember?!
Jim $ 	Go back. I'm going to kill him.	You do that and you'll have murdered your father.
What are you looking at?	The Admiral's son.	Don't you believe it.
Spock!	The ship $  out of danger?	Yes $ 
He's not what I expected, Sir.	What did you expect, Lieutenant?	He's very human.
You just said there aren't any except on Earth of the past.	That is what I said, Doctor.	Then how.?
All right, Commander, you wanna tell us anything?	Like what?	Like who you really are and what you're doing here and what this thing is.
With pleasure.	Well, that's different.	If you'll follow me, Professor $ 
My father told me I shouldn't talk to you.	I understand.	I don't.
Perhaps it would surprise you to know that I have often tried to imagine what it would be like to be a child# 	Really?	Really.
We're taking this ship out of here#  this mission is over# 	It is not over.	It is over.
You haven't done that in a long time# 	What# ?	What you're doing to my neck# 
You seem to have an answer for everything.	Something wrong with that?	Not yet.
What?	You're lying.	What makes you say that?
Yes, sir. But Captain#  are we#  all going back?	Unless you'd like to stay.	No, sir.
What is it with you, anyway?	Still think we're finished?	More than ever.
I don't believe we can get more out of the way than this.	They'll make it look like an accident# 	What are you in for, if you don't mind me asking?
What took you so long?	Kill him! He's the one!!	Not me, idiot - HIM!
Stand down your weapons.	Captain, if $ 	Stand DOWN, Mr. Scott. All stop. That's an order.
Do you know who I am?	You are me.	No. My name is Data#  I am your brother.
That's your life#  not mine.	Please.	It too late.
Where did you stop last?	What the hell do you think you're doing?	Where did you stop last?
We'll need a lot of help, George. You could hide an army up here.	I'm going to the White House right now. I'll try and get you everything you need.	Wait, wait#  What are my orders if we find this thing?
What?!	Eh#  police.	Police# 
No gas.	No gas.	This car runs on gas.
No gas#  car dead.  We need gas. I don't want to get shot for running out of gas.	Gas good?	Yes. Very good.
Go.	It's closed#  closed. We need one that's open.	Closed?
That's a big help. Where are you from?	From?	Are you from up there? Space?
Who?	My#  husband.	I am husband?
Shit.	Shit?	No, no#  don't say that. Bad word.
When do you have to be here?	I do not understand.	How will I do this one?# 
Sun# 	Yes.	Sun#  day. No sun#  night. You understand?
Don't worry. They're not going to hurt you. Come on.  Only show this to the driver. Nobody else. And don't lose it.	Can I have the gun?	No.
Well#  I'm going to go now.	Go?	Yes. I have a long ride ahead of me#   Goodbye.
Goodbye.	What?	It's a kiss#   Goodbye# 
What are you doing?	Are you my friend?	Yes.
Nobody knows.	Why?	I don't know.
I like this music.	I've noticed#  Do you understand what they're saying?	Not all#  but it feels like a kiss.
Do you have music up there?	Yes.	I'd like to hear it. Can you sing something?
You shouldn't drink so much of that stuff. It's bad for you.	On the radio they say it's good.	Hurry up.
The machine gave me two. Should I put one back?	No. Get in.	You can have one.
Where are you going?	I must meet my ship.	Why can't we wait here for a ride?
Asshole!!	Where did you learn that?	The cook.
What are you saying?	You can stop. I will go on alone.	We're too far away to walk. Don't you understand?
You are cold.	You're damn right I am.	I do not get cold.
Hello#  hello. How are you this morning?	Do they talk?!	No, they don't talk#  We talk to them.
This is yours# 	If you want to keep it, you can.	I'd like to# 
I love you.	I'm never going to see you again, am I?	No.
Tell the baby about me.	I will.	Goodbye.
Jesus Christ!! You crazy people# 	Call the police!!	Hey buddy#  let her go# 
I told you I'm looking for someone.	In the cars, too?!	I don't know where he is.
I don't feel anything.  Is it on?	Forget it's there.	Make me forget it, baby.
I understand.  No, I'm not.	You understand?  Attorney!  Right? Am I right?	That's right.
Jesus.	Yeah.  So don't walk near me in public, alright.	Thanks, buddy.  See#  things weren't bad enough.  They weren't fucking bad enough!
What the fuck are you doing?	Coming with you.	You will not live to see the morning.
Think back about what she said. Exactly what she said.	She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car# 	Something in your car# 
We got to make another copy of this. Little life insurance.	You know what this tape could do if it gets out.	I've got a good idea, yeah.
Take it to him.	A cop?  You want me to trust a cop?!	No.  Trust me.
Oh boy.  What if you're wrong?	Then we'll be right where we are now.	Yeah, right.  Fucked.
Was this him?	Um#  he was older.	Besides that.
My God.	Not bad, huh?	You're a#  you're sick.
Calm down, Harold.  Okay, here's what we're going to do, Harold: there's a pull off up ahead, we're going to stop there.	Oh God, mister, please leave me alone.	You're going to miss it. Pay attention.
I haven't changed anything.  Damn.	I# 	I've got to take a piss.
Is he dead?	Yeah.	The boy's okay. I saw him# 
How are you ladies doing this evening?	What do you drive?	I'm sorry?
Hi.	Hi.	I'm Mike.
# and boy does it hurt when they ask.	I don't even tell them about anything I'm close on anymore# 	# not until you book it# 
The poor thing. Six years?	# And she's with someone else.	The poor thing. I'll make some coffee.
He's so sweet. He really said that?	I believe it too. He really just wants her to be happy.	He is so sweet.
On the table.	Sorry?	You have to lay it on the table.
Well#  This is it.	Listen. I had a great time.	Me too.
Well, I should be getting# 	# It's really getting late.	# home. It's getting late. Yeah.
Can I give you a ride to your car# ?	# Nah. I'm right across the street# 	# Which one# ?
Hi. Sorry about that.	You didn't have to get off the other line. I would've called you back.	That's okay. I wanted to talk to you.
How's it going? It's been a while# 	# Six months.	How are you doing?
Hi.	I heard you might be moving back# 	Yeah, uh, I don't think that's gonna be happening any time soon#  Listen, can I call you right back? I gotta take this call# 
And what if I don't want to give up on her?	You don't call.	But you said I shouldn't call if I wanted to give up on her.
So, if the party starts at eight, why are we first going to a bar at ten?	To get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven.	Oh.  Where is this place?
I think I'm gonna move Back East.	Well, that's dumb.	What's dumb about it?
You miss the pain?	# for the same reason you miss her. You lived with it so long.	Wow.  You wanna grab a bite?
I can't lose more than a hundred.	Just bring your card. Half an hour.	Wait.
That's where we make our scene.	You think they're watching?	Oh, they're watching all right. They're watching.
Double down.	What?!?	Double down, baby. You gotta double down on an eleven.
I'm telling you, baby, you always double down on an eleven.	Yeah? Well obviously not always!	Always, baby.
No, man. I need to use the phone.	What?	I gotta use the phone.
How you guys doing?	It's on.	Which one?
What are you doing?	What?	You looked right at her, baby.
Was I money?	I don't know. It was kind of a dick move if you ask me.	Why, baby? What'd I do wrong?
How long do I wait to call?	A day.	Tomorrow?
It's not like that# 	Don't give me that! She liked you, man.	I know she liked me. I mean, it's not like I wanted to do anything with her tonight.
Is she looking at me, baby?	No.	Now?
Baby, don't talk that way, baby# 	You are so money, and you don't even know it# 	That's what I keep trying to tell him.  You're so money, you don't even know# 
# Sue# 	Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once?	# Shut up, Sue# 
No.  You ask for too much.	I ask for Justice.	The Court gave you justice.
The food is on the table.	I'm not hungry yet.	Eat it, it's on the table.
You heard about your father?	Yeah.	The word is out in the streets that he's dead.
Have you thought about a wife?  A family?	No.	I understand, Michael.  But you must make a family, you know.
Your wife and children# you're happy with them?	Yes.	Good.
Who are those girls?	That's for you to find out.	Give them some money and send them home.
What was that?	An accident.  No one was hurt.	Listen Tom, I let my cab go; can I come in to call another one?
Sure.  Anything I can do for you.	No.  I guess I'll see you Christmas. Everyone's going to be out at Long Beach, right?	Right.
Michael, what are those men doing?	They're waiting to see my father.	They're talking to themselves.
I never know when you're telling me the truth.	I told you you wouldn't like him.	He's coming over here!
Michael?	I'm thinking about it.	Michael# 
I can't# 	Please say it.	Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?
Michael, it's not true.  Please tell me.	Don't ask me.	Tell me!
It'll just be for a little while. He can be#  he makes me laugh.	Okay, darling.	You'd say if you mind?
I told you. He gave them to me.	Why? When?	I feel as if you haven't heard anything I've been saying to you.
Will we see you later?	I can't later.	And tomorrow?
Are you okay?	I'm fine.	Do you want me to stick around?
Tom, are you okay?	You try. You try talking to her.	Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?
Ask me what I want to change about this moment.	What do you want to change about this moment?	Nothing.
Where are you going?	I'm leaving.	What do you mean?
These are not the kind of movies I go to.	Well, I don't follow movies too much# 	You mean these are the only kind of movies you go to?
What about the record?	Keep it.	Can I call you?
Sure. What do you think? She wanted to get out of the cab. I said "Look, you're in the middle of the fucking bridge# "	You said that?	Well, I said, "Lady, please, we're on a bridge# "
Hello.	You looking for some action?	Well#  I guess so.
What's your name?	Easy.	That ain't much of a name.
Can't you listen to me? Don't you want to get out of here?	Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.	But you're the one that wanted to get away. You're the one that came into my cab.
Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it!	You can do it in my mouth.	Don't you understand anything?
Do you understand why I came here?	I think so. I tried to get into your cab one night, and now you want to come and take me away.	Don't you want to go?
Well, I tried.	I understand, mister. It means something, really.	Can I see you again?
Sure you don't want to come with me?	I can't. Otherwise, I would.	I sure hate to go alone# 
Get it.	Hey, mister, I don't know what's going on here. This don't make any sense.	Show it to me.
This Luke was a pretty good guy, wasn't he?	Oh, yes.  Yes, he was.	Well#  let me tell you, I'm not Luke.  I know who I am now, and you don't.  And#  I don't like me very much.
How'd it go?	Not as bad as I thought it would. I think I passed.	That's my girl!  Did you# ?
What.	No, I#  I just wondering where you've been all this time.	Me too.
You first.	Why me?	Be a gentleman.  You have to help me down.
So, you're really gonna be a lawyer?	And why not?	Whoa.
What was that?	Nothing.  	Do you have the# 
This is strange.  Do you feel it?	What?	We've done this before, so many times.  The last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday.
What#  do you remember?	Well#  everything.  It started coming back a couple of days ago. I remember everything now.	I see# 
Excuse me#  what's your, um, your name?	Harry, son.  Harry.	And#  what's my name again?
Jesus# 	The film broke# 	I know, I know#  keep still.
I'm here.	Did you#  did you# 	Did I what?
Nope.  Can't.  We're through.	Then I'll call you a cab.	I'll save you the trouble.  I'm a cab.  There.  Did it myself.
You smell gas?	Don't smell nothin'.  He must not be dead in here.	Jesus.
You think he's drunk somewhere?	Wouldn't blame him if he was.	Well, his rent's past due and he said to call you in case of an emergency.  He lose his job or somethin'?
Sit.  Play with me.	No, I# 	Some of it might come back to you.
What happened?	What exactly did you hear?	That you got let go.
You hungry, son?	Yes.  Very.	Got any money?
I was wondering# 	Yes?	That sign.  Do you think I could have the room for a single night?
Why didn't Annie stay for dinner?	She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.	Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
Good morning.	Morning.	I wonder if you could help me.
Do you know him?	Yep.	Where does he live?
I wonder if you could tell me# 	Yep?	The little girl's name.
That's the last of it.	Did you close the door?	And locked it.
I wonder if you could help me.	What?	I said I wonder if you could help me.
So you came up to see Annie, huh?	Yes.	I don't believe you.  I think you came up to see me.
Yes, but# 	You are, aren't you?	Certainly, but# 
Why did he shoot her?	He was watching a ball game on television.	What?
You'll be able to find your way back, won't you?	Oh, yes.	Will I be seeing you again?
I'd still like to see you.	Why?	I think it could be fun.
It's so damn quiet out there.	It was like that yesterday.	What do you mean?
Do you want to try your father again? 	I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.	Have we still got power?
When will they stop?	I thought they'd have stopped by now.	What time is it?
I'm going out that way, lady. You can follow me.	Then let's go. Now!	I haven't finished my drink.
He's not home.	Where can I find him?	You don't went to find him. Your news will keep until I tell him.
Are you a doctor, too?	Not yet.	You'll be a good doctor.  I know all about doctors.
Can anyone hear what we say?	Only Brother.	I know that you kill people to sell bodies.
What did they give you?	They showed me pictures, what he did to her. Evidence. Said all I had to do was stand up there and not my head "yes."	What did they give you?
Yeah, no kidding.	Your father gave them to both of you.	And he's right over there by the way.  What did you do to your face?
You're in with them.	It's not what you think.	You killed her!
They killed her because she found out.	About you.	About them. You've got to leave it alone.
Bobby$ ! What are you doing up at this hour?	I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had to tell you!	Tell me what?
Hello$ 	You ready?	I will be in just a minute.

You like Michael.	I like Michael.	You better not like him too much.
Still mad at me?	For what.	For everything.

Michael, are you still in bed?	No.  I'm up.	Michael, will you do me a favor this evening?  Will you stay home with Sam tonight?  I'm meeting Max for dinner after work.
Sure.	Does that mean we are, or we aren't?	We are# 
Max is coming for dinner, Michael. I'd like you to meet him.	Can't.  Got plans of my own.	There's only three weeks left of summer, Michael.  Things are going to change around here when school starts.
Tell them to get something to eat.	I thought we were poor.	Not that poor.
Sam.  Is everything all right?	Mom.  I think we've got to have a long talk about something?	What's wrong?  Tell me.

I said where?  Where'd you go?!	Was dark#  find a light# 	You lying bastard# 
What are you doing?	Could be important work.  Might as well bring it back.	It's getting late.  Hurry it.  I'm going to check the last few rooms.
#  Guys as crazy as that could have done a lot of damage to their own before they got to us.	Nothing we can do about that.	Yes, there is.  I'd like to go up.
I don't see how#  when I'm finished I return it right away.	When was the last time you used it?	A day or so ago#  I guess.
Hey, man# !	You reach anybody yet?	We're a thousand miles from anybody else, man.  It's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.
Put that down!	No.	I'll put this right through your head.
Maybe it ain't coming.	Then we go after him.	Bet the last place you ever go.
Now how did you get hurt?	I had an accident.	I figured that.  What kind of accident?
There's a place that might help#  we could try going there.	Where?	The Hall of Books.
I think we should go on by ourselves.	No# 	Please, just listen to me#  Your mother would be very cross with me if you got hurt.  I'll find her.
#  Well, you wanted to see it.	This is it?	Around here.
Because you'll never die.	Excuse me?	You'll live like this forever. Alone.  You were meant to help.  To be with people.  Not like this.
When was his mother taken?	Last night.	Send him away.
It's what they want you to see.	This is the way in?	Yes#  Are you sure you want to do this?
What's it all for?	The air#  the power.	Why did they built it?
This has to end.	End# ?	This has to end.
What?	Go back to where you came from.  Or die here.	Why would you let me go back?
You're late.	Got here as soon as I could.	Dance with me# 
You promised me flowers.	What?	You promised me flowers tonight, don't you even remember?
You're late.	Got here as soon as I could.	Dance with me# 
Alex, what is it?	Holding you#  again.	Darling.
Let's walk through the park# 	No#  let's walk through the city.	All right# 
In the future, we'll be better.	What?	Nothing.
Why?	Why not?	Why would you do that?
Where do they take them?!	We don't know.	We have to go after them, find where $  !
I don't know what to tell you, sir. He's been gone this whole week.	And you've no idea where he went?	No, sir.
You ok?	I'm fine.	[Beat] Listen, I hate to bother you# 
And what's that?	My business?	Yes.
Who are you?	I think you know. Your eyes say you do.	[Beat] You're his son?
Look here, I don't like you getting in my face and saying this bullshit to me# 	That's too bad.	I thought you said you never knew your father.
You done with your small talk?	Sure.	Good.
This is really happening, isn't it?	[Beat] What do you need me to do?	[Beat] Thank you.
I need to get this letter to someone.	I can't take you out of here in your condition# 	And I can't stay here in my condition. I am going to die tonight. It's already been decided.
Come on, mom. Don't fall asleep# 	You two ok?	Our car won't start.
Your mom take anything before this happened?	Yeah, but I don't know what.	[Beat] What's your name?
They're not here.	They're not.	[Beat, lost] No.
I don't know. Maybe that's because this whole thing is a dream. How can you have a street with no cars on it?	I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are.	Then why isn't there anyone around?
You gotta stop thinking like that.	Then, where are you going?	Nowhere. [Beat] I just think I'm gonna be sick.
I've been ok.	Good. How's your mom?	Ok, I guess.
And if I didn't want to come?	I guess I'd ask you why.	Because I don't think I'm crazy.
Why, what would you do?	I could try to# make it stop.	No. I don't want it to.
What do you mean?	You have no idea what's going on.	No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you.
Why don't you help me?	Because I don't have time.	Why not?
I'm not gonna let that happen.	You still don't believe me, do you?	I do believe you# 
You know how to get there?	Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough.	Good.
I'm not sure.	You don't have anywhere to stay?	I don't think so.
Well, where are you from?	I'm not sure. [Beat] I don't really know.	Of course you don't know.
Honey?	Yes, baby?	Do you think you could ever shoot someone?
I've been better.	You girls are in some hot water.	Yes, sir.  I know.
Oh shit.	What's wrong?	Stop.
Well, I guess I'd better# 	Wait# !  Um, where ya going?	I don't know.  Nowhere.  What are you doin'?
Hello# 	Who is it?	It's me.
Is this your car?	Yes.	You wanna come with me, please? Walk around and get in the car, please.
How much longer is it gonna be?  I'm hungry.	Another hour of so.  We've got enough food for a month.	I'll never make it#  Can't we stop just for a few minutes# 
Oh, I don't know.  I'm just nervous. I gotta figure out what to do.	Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.	Just what the hell is wrong with you?
Call him?	Call him.  Don't tell him anything. Tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night.	Will I be?
What's wrong with you?	Nothing.  Why?  Do I seem different?	Yes, now that you mention it.  You seem crazy.  Like you're on drugs.
What do we do?  What do you want to do?!	I don't know!  Shit!  Let's just play it by ear.  He may not know. He may just give me a ticket.	Please, God, please don't let us get caught.  Please, please, please# 
I think I've really fucked up.  I think I've got us in a situation where we could both get killed.  Why didn't we just go straight to the police.	You know why.  You already said.	What'd I say again?
You know what's happened, don't you?	What?	We've gone insane.
How far are we from Mexico?	About two hundred and fifty miles.	How long do you think that'll take?
Shit!	What?!	What?!  What d'you think?!
Hi!	Hi there!  You alright?	We're fine!  How are you?
I'm asking you to leave.	Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all wrong.  I'm not leaving# 	# Not until I get a little something to remember you by.
It must be great with a wife like that.	Each day is better than the next.  Have you ever been, you know#  in love with someone?	Nah.
Oh God, I'm fucking nervous. I don't know if I'm ready for this, man.	Just relax. Have you hit the cash machine?	Got cash.
Bob, do you remember Mary?	Who?	Mary.
Take it easy, that's Bill.	Tell Bill to get the fuck off!	Relax, he just ate.
Well, it was nice meeting you, again.	Same here again.	By the way, what's your name?
Don't you want to know my name?	I already know it, Mary.	How'd you know that?
So# 	Yeah#  I guess this is it, huh?	I guess.
Mary ah, forget it.	What?	No, forget it, it was stupid.
Are you okay?	Not to worry. So#  see you tonight, right? Right?	Sure.
But you know, you shit out a bunch of kids, you're going to put on a few pounds.	So she's married?	Nope. Never been.
Look, uh, I've been thinking about everything you told me.	Good good.	Well I think you're right, I should look her up.
Oh Christ#  poor dog.	You're a sick man, you know that?	Yeah well fuck you! You just can't stand the fact that it was my turn.
Well you didn't have to blow us both out of the water. Jesus Christ, just because she found out about you, why'd you have to take me down with you?	I don't know what you're talking about.	I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
By the way, how's he doing?	He's dead.	Oh, Ted I'm so sorry to hear that.
Hey.	Hi, Ted.	You look great.
It's too bad you don't live down here, Ted.	Yeah?	We've got a lot in common.
So you're a writer?	Trying to be.	Well good for you. I bet it works out for you.
Ted#  you're not that far ahead.	Look, Mary, the truth is#  I'll be in town for a while now but I don't think we should see each other for a few weeks.	Why not?
Mary, I swear I wasn't trying to trick you.	Then what the fuck did you do it for?	I did it because because I'd never stopped thinking about you and if I didn't find you I knew my life would never be good again.
Please leave.	Mary, come on# 	Go!
Get over here.	Really?	Really.
I, uh#  I got it stuck.	You got what stuck?	It.
Hey.	So what's up?	Eh.
The sun came up today.	Yeah.	It shouldn't have. But it did.
How's my favorite President?	Busy. But you've got his heart.	I want an hour with him.
Get back out there, kid. Remember to hit 'em hard.	What about you? Where are you going?	Back to work.
I was eating that.	No you weren't.	I was, you bastard.
I did.	Who the fuck is he?	$  a fucking cop.
What was he saying?	Why should I tell you.	Because he was talking to me.
I beg your pardon.	No, I beg yours. But I don't think you're right on that.	Why not?
I can't.	I thought there was something#  That night in the club# 	Lieutenant# 
Let's make it at eight.	Make what?	Anything.
Danger?	. Yeah!	Doesn't it ever bother you?
# they say you're alright.	I'm fine.	This is it, then.
No.	What do you want?	I want it back.
What do you do when you come here?	I sit. I think. I play games.	What kind of games?
You didn't mean it. You didn't think. You'd do anything to take it back.	That's three.	And that's one!
Looks like a tie.	Who's gonna win?	We'll say it together. On the count of three# One# two# 
No! Not again!	What are you talking about, we gotta go!	I'm not losing it again!
Is there something I should know?	Just relax.	Is it the plane?
You're not supposed to# 	But I have to!	Then# shit! Go ahead. I'm right behind you.
You hear that? Anything we want. Anything# Well???	Well what?	What do you want?
Come on, we're next.	What?	Come on, I got over six bucks on the line.
Hear about Ice?	What now?	He won again.
I guess I owe you one.	You don't owe me anything. We're on the same team.	You saved our lives. You did it!
Figured it out yet?	Figured out what?	Who is the best.
I# FORGOT SOMETHING.	What the hell you doing?	Helping him in.
Where's yours?	Over there man.	You got the job.
He had help.  From our side, sir.	I know that.	But I thought# 
Bob?	What is it?	You better get down here.
Harry, what the hell is this?	Come on, let's go have that drink.	What the fuck did I do wrong?!  Tell me!
Who is she?	Nobody.	Nobody?!  What's her name?
Not talk!  I said TALK!!	I'm not your wife.	The hell you're not.
They'll be here any minute!  They'll kill you all!	What's he talking about?	Let me go!
I don't remember you.	What are you talking about?	I don't remember you.  I don't remember us.  I don't even remember me.
What's wrong?	I just has a terrible thought# What is this is all a dream?	Then kiss me quick# before you wake up.
Wait!	What?	# Who are you?
I might have an idea# 	We're gonna have to come up with some kind of plan or it's just gonna wait us to death.	Well, I was wondering if we could# 
I'm making the run to the Cat.	Like hell you are.	Get real.  I'm faster than you.
They're# they're trying to make us move!	Or just knock us over.  Look, use the bomb!	It's out last one.  We can't kill them all.
Use the fucking bomb!	So, we get back on that rock and in three days we're dead anyway.	I want to live for the three days.
Look, I'm a lawyer and $ 	$  I don't care who you are. You could've been killed. Every man and woman in here has done hard prison time. And we look out for each other.	"We"?
You see that? You wanna be like that?	No. No# 	You fucking swear to shut up!
Murder witness.	You're doing a murder case?	It hasn't been that long.
It's okay. It was always like that.	Shouldn't one of us# ?	No $  leave him be. It's better for everyone.
No#  No, go away.	I'm glad you let me talk to you. You used to not let me talk to you.	Go away. I am not talking to you.
No.	I want you to kill for me.	No. Never. You'll have to kill me.
What did Gordon's tie mean?	What? That's just Gordon's bad taste.	Why couldn't he have just told you all these things?
Right on time, baby.	Buy me a ticket to The Great Went.	We're on our way, Baby.
Where were you last night? We were supposed to get together. You didn't show up.	You were supposed to show up. Maybe I wasn't.	We were supposed to be together.
I've got to see you.	Not now.	This afternoon?
What the hell is wrong with you?	That's right. There's no place left to go is there, James?	What do you mean?
Can I take the car?	Sure honey, what's the hurry?	I forgot my books at school.
Who was that?	A friend from school.	A special friend?
Dad#  Dad#  Who was that? How do you know him? He looked familiar. Have I met him?	No, you haven't met him. Have you met him?	No.
Dad?	Yes.	Did you come home during the day last week?
DON'T MAKE ME DO IT.	NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.	I always thought you knew it was me.
What are you doing?	Who am I?	I don't know.
If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?	Well, of course, it's always dangerous# 	I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win?
Nothing that we can do can make that woman well.	And no one will know the truth.	What is the truth?
That's the call that I'm waiting for.	What does it mean?	They want to settle.  It means a lot of money.
Thank you# 	# that's perfectly all right.	Uh, why, why are you doing this?
Thank you.	You're really#   You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?	Who told you that?
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?	Yes.	What did she say?
What is it?	Thank you for seeing me.	That's perfectly all right.
D'you find an apartment?	Still looking.	I changed my life today. What did you do?
Would you like me to leave# ?  Is this a bad time $  ?	What# ?	Is this a bad time.
I've got to work# 	Do you want me to go# ?	No, no, I'm just# 
Why don't you get some rest?	I've got to work.	You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed. It's all right. I'll stay here with you. It's all right. Come on# 
Do you think it's my fault?	Isn't there something you# 	That's not the question. It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault? If I'd#  if I'd#  I never should have taken it. There was no way that I was going to win.
And it's over# ?	Yes.	Well, then what are you doing here?
Is it over?	No.	What are you going to do?
Well, well, well. Huh?	Yeah.	It's a long road that has no turning.
Hi, Mickey# 	What the hell do you think you're doing# ?  What's going on here# ?	Uh# 
I have to talk to you.	What do you want?	Come on. Let's get a drink.
Okay. What do you do when you don't have a witness?	You use their witness.	That's right.
I spoke to her, and everything is all right.	I, what are you talking about? I talked to her this morning, and she said# 	She told me.
We'd be the first to make contact with 'em $  see?	We'd be in all the papers!	Hey, how about that!
Is that#  machine# ?	It's gone now.	Where are we?
Nothing there now.	It was#   # one of them!	What was it like?
Maybe they aren't too sure we're here.	They could be as curious about us as we are about them.	Maybe #   Maybe they want to take us alive.
I probably wouldn't be able to get to them if I tried# 	You'll be all right with us# .  # for as long as anybody's got!	Don't let's lose each other.
Must be somebody in there.	Who?  Where d'you think they come from!	How would I know# !
You okay?	I'm fine.	Everything went great, I thought.  We really got you, didn't we?
I want to see the body.	No, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.	I want to see for myself.
I'd have liked to have said goodbye.	He knows.	You sound so sure.
You may not like what you hear.	I can take it.	They've become what you wanted. They're a crew.  That's why he came.
Feels different doesn't it?	What?	That we're going back.  I don't want it to end.  I don't want to be what I was when I left.
You know, I never had friends like this.	Me either.	I feel like#  we can do anything.
Why'd you do it?	What's the difference?	You only hurt yourself you know?
How ya doing?	Fine.	Good.
Who told you that?	My dad.	It works?
Can't do it.	Sir# ?	Close the door.  Sit down.
Well, we thought we'd drop in and see if you were all still in one piece.	And, of course, we are.	Well, you never can tell these days, can you?
Yeah, well you're really gonna have some bad dreams if we find out you didn't.	That's enough.	How the hell are we gonna get outta here?
What's your problem?	Why'd you jump?	Because I felt like it.  What do you care?
What are we supposed to talk about?	You've gotta be kidding?	But, they don't speak English.
Do you have something to say?	No.	Then keep your mouth shut.
What's it going to be?	I'm sorry# 	Sorry won't cut it.
No.	What makes you so sure it was one?	I can't be sure.
Yes, that's true.	Do you think this is funny?  Some kind of joke?  You lost six people out there.	I don't think one second of this is funny, sir.
I still ain't sure what my daddy looks like.	Like you, sweetheart. You and your daddy got the same mouth, eyes, ears, and nose. Only difference is your color hair is like mine.	My daddy ain't never killed nobody, has he, mama?
I'm scared, mama.	Why, honey?	Case daddy don't like me. What if he don't like that I don't got his color hair.
Mama???	You know who it was and you know you aren't, and I mean ARE NOT gonna see him EVER#  End of story.	Like hell.
I knew you'd want it again# 	That's not why I called.	Oh yeah - sure#  okay.
So. Is he any good?	No. Not yet he isn't.	Well, I'm going to read it anyway.
Shut up, James.	So what's the problem?	There is no problem. Did I say there was a problem?
So $  what do we do now?	Find the jacket.	Oh! Huh. Exactly how do we do that?
I passed out.	You did.	I've been doing that a lot lately.
You cold, James?	A little.	So what are you doing out here?
James.  Don't leave just yet. There's something I think you ought to see.	I'll miss my bus.	This is worth it.
Go ahead.	Really?	Really.
He didn't give his name.	Who?	The guy on the phone.
Afraid so.	That's a big book you're writing.	I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
It's because you don't eat.	I eat.	When?
Thanks for that. He all right?	I think so#  What about you?	Me? Sure. Why?
I uh, I didn't finish, I#  fell asleep.	That good, huh?	No, it's not that, it's# 
Not have it.	No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?	Well, no, I don't see any way.  And I know how hard it is for you to $  to lose this chance.
He told you.	He told me.	And what did you say?
Did you tell Walter?	I told Walter.	Does he still love you?
What made you pull out that old thing?	I was thinking of you.	And?
You doing okay?	Got a job at old Frank's place. His son runs it now.	Oh man, that kid takes himself real serious.
I've got some pictures.  Want to see?	No thanks.	Ah, come on.
Aren't you glad?	When?	Soon.
Something like that.	That was terrific.	You should hear the bird.
Don't you have friends?	I have friends.	A pretty girl like you should have a lot of friends.
You don't know?	I have no idea.	I think you do.
You knew her?	What?	The girl.
I'd keep away from him.	What?	The new man. I'd keep away from him, if I were you.
Yeah, like the bird.	Can I ask how old you are?	I'm twelve.
Walter.	Do you have many friends?	No.
But will he#  ?	Your daddy will always love you.	How do you know?
No.	I don't mind.	You should go home.
And how's your job?	The job's okay.	Do I take "okay" to mean you feel good about working there?
Try it.	No fucking way.	Then think about it.
You don't like coming here, do you?	It's okay.	But you don't like coming here. Be honest, Walter.
How long is this going to take?	We have a few more minutes.	I mean, when will I be normal.
I don't know.	What did you think would happen?	I don't know.
You're very late.	Sorry.	Please don't do it again.
Close your eyes.	What?	I'd like you to close your eyes.
Where is she? What is she doing? How old $ 	Not so fast.	Sorry.  Where is she?
Don't ever do that again.	All right.	I don't like nobody behind my back!
When the two of you held each other. When you were ten or eleven and she was eight or nine. When your parents were out and the two of you were alone#  completely alone in that big house.	It was a small house.	All right. A small house#  with small rooms.
It's going to take time, Walter.	Time.	How do you feel about that?
There's something wrong with this picture.	What picture?	I'm talking about you.
You're quiet at work.	I'm just quiet.	You don't hang out with the other guys.
So?	What?	Are you going to tell me your deep dark secret before we have sex?
What's the problem?	You think I have a problem?	Do you?
Tell me about it.	Maybe later.	How about in the morning.
What's the worst thing you ever did?	The worst?	Yeah.
Sorry.	What did you do to them?	It's not what you think.
What was prison like?	You don't really $ 	Yes! I want to know.
You know, this is crazy.	What?	Being here, with me.
Maybe this isn't a good idea.	What?	Us seeing each other.
You're scared.	I'm not scared.	Neither am I.
We should live together.	Live together.	Move in with me.
I don't even know how to live with myself.	Just think about it.	I've got problems.
Don't be scared, Walter.	I'm not scared.	Prove it.
I didn't sleep well.	Do you want to talk about it?	I need a shower.
You okay?	Yeah.	Fucking liar.
Okay#  okay.  We gotta get you out of here.	How?	I don't know how!
Hey#  big boys don't cry, remember?	Hi, lady.	Hi, tough guy.  I guess it worked, huh?
Is that it?  Is this right?	Yeah!  I mean, I don't know#  it looks right.	All right.  Do it!
And how long will you be away?	Four or five days.	Oh, very well. I'll just spend the weekend alone by myself and take a little rest. I should be used to it by now.
Well?	Well, what?	Have you decided?
Have you read it?#  They're asking for anyone with information to get in touch with them.	Yes. I had also thought of going there to talk with them# 	Yes, you should go.
Good night, my love.	Good night. Tell me that you love me.	I love you.
We have a radio like this, too.	No, not like this one.	And why wouldn't we have one like this?
You have a lovely voice.	No I don't.	I just heard you.
No I'm not.	Hasn't anyone ever told you that before?	Let's talk about something else.
First thing that comes to your mind?	God!  But there's nothing to say about God.	Second thing that comes to your mind.
You want to talk about the baby don't you?	Would you like to talk about it?	I never saw any baby#  I think they made it up.
You liked Sister Paul?	She was kind to me. She told me I was beautiful.	What else did she tell you?
What did you do?	I'm always bad.	What did you do?
How did you have a baby?	It came out of me.	Did you know what was going to come out?
What is it?	Someone's following me.	Who?
Which one?	I don't know which one 	Of what?
Who?	Go away, I don't want you here.	Is someone in the room with you?
It was dead.	It was alive wasn't it?	I don't remember.
Larry# 	Marty, what are you doing here?	Larry there's got to be something missing.
No, no, no# 	I can get you new evidence next week.	No!
Oh that one there, in the corner.	The one up on the third floor?	Yes.
May I be present?	Of course.	Then let's begin.
Lay them down.	Eh?	Lay them down.
They're yours.	They are?	The cards#  you're bank.
You don't think# 	They'll be here.	Oh now, they can't do that to me.  It's all your fault.  Oh yes it is and if they don't turn up I wouldn't be in your shoes for all the# 
Oh no, you're not. You've gone too far this time #  and who's paying for all this?	It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.	Oh, well that's all right.  What?
No, that's his other one.	That's all right then.	Clean though, isn't he?
What are you doing there?	Hiding.	I think you're soft or something.
Eh #  pardon me for asking but who's that little old man?	What little old man?	That little old man.
Now get on with it.	We were going to do it.	Aye, well, now! 
Hello.	Hello.	Oh, wait a minute, don't tell me you're # 
I've got the stuff. Come here.	Aren't we # 	No, we're not!
Look after him.	But# 	Do I have to raise me voice?
Yeah, you want to watch it.	It's not my fault.	Well, you stick to that story, son.
Maybe we can get in by the top.	You want to try?	Sure.
Can we come up?	No, it's too small, only room enough for one person.	Can you see anything in the hole?
How long to fix?	Hard to say.	Well, get started.
He died.	What?	Not they#  he# 
Hey, are you guys still there? What's going on?	Meet us on the bridge.  Be careful $  it's huge now.	Right.
We've got six hours left.	Oh my God.	Does anybody know what happened?
Now what's wrong?	I've completely lost their signal.	Can you get them back?
It's close, real close.	How far?	We should be almost on top of it.  I just can't quite# 
It won't come $  it's stuck.	What is it?	How the hell should I know?  Come on, give me a hand, let's get him out of there!
They're getting pretty close now.	All right, then $  when it gets to the other side of the door, you sing out, then drop the door.  Okay?	Okay.
Find anything we missed?	I don't even know what I'm looking for.	Still worried?
Two down, four to go.	What's that supposed to mean?	Nothing.
Kill me# 	What did it do to you?	Look# 
Whoa, wait a minute# 	What?	Just got a reading# 
Alright, okay.  Look# 	What?	I'll come with you.
Hold it, hold it# 	What's wrong?	I'm picking up another signal.
I'm about to go into the shower, I won't be able to hear you# 	I can wait. Where would you like to go? We'll make this a special night# 	You take charge.
Just like that, eh?	Just like that.	Do you know, Eve - sometimes I think you keep things from me.
I don't suppose there's a drink left# 	You can have one at Max's.	I don't think I'm going.
You've already met.	Where?	Right here. A minute ago.
Thank you.	Nothing, really# 	The kid - junior, that is - will be right down. Unless you'd like to take her drink up to her# 
It's obvious you're not a woman.	I've been aware of that for some time.	Well, I am.
If I only knew how# 	Try# 	Well# 
May I have your coat?	Don't bother, I can take it up myself# 	Please# 
What about Bill?	What about Bill?	He's in love with you.
Carl?	Yeah?	Fuck you, Carl.
What the hell was that?	Sorry.	No, it was good.
Nice car.	I'm glad you think so.	You don't like it?
What about the game?!	I'm not playing.	You're missing the game for us?!
But, but $  what would I do?	Anything!  Just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something.	That's stupid.
Can I come in?	Yeah, sure.	You're not# busy?
Are you gonna do what I think you're gonna do?	Don't you want me to?	Oh yeah!  Put it in your mouth!
I'll just say that we had a great night together.	Hang in there, buddy, you'll get there.	I know.
It's true.  I mean, after this, everything'll be different.	After getting laid?	After high school.
Uh# 	Move with the music.	Um# okay# 
You comfortable?	Yeah, are you?	Yeah.
You sure you're comfortable?	Yeah.  Are you sure?	Yeah.
Here! Come on! Do it! Go ahead.	What# ?	You know what. Kill me. Cut out my fucking heart. Go on! Do it!
I know where he'll go.	Where?	Somewhere where there are no police, and plenty to eat.
God. I can't believe it.	What?	It's making me hungry.
I have to go now, before it gets light.	But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!	Then you'll have to make your own home. Lots of people do.
It's her.	He's her?	Look!
Hey, listen, listen.	What?	Gimme a kiss.
You followed me. I can't believe it!	I didn't follow you!	You followed me!
I'm home!	Oh, yeah? How'd it go?	Oh, it was#   really weird. But she's a very nice woman.
Here's a real present.	What#  huh?	Check it out.
What'd I do?	Step up here!	What'd I do?
I think he has a little thing for Annie.	Oh, no, no, that's bullshit, Max. He goes with that girl over there.	Where?
Oh, yes, that's right. Did you see the new play?	Oh, you remember her, Annie.	Yes, I do.
Why didn't you bring him?	What?	Why didn't you bring him?
I'm the hired help.	Fuck you.	I never put myself in harm's way.
That for us?	What a nose.  You missed your calling.	Can I open it?
I call that a perfect day.	A perfect night.	Damn near.  And a damn near perfect drug.
Go.	Hey!  Would you?	It was fifteen seconds.
No.  Did you?	No.  I missed that.	I missed all of you.  We're okay, aren't we?
I can't got tonight.  I don't want to be on a plane on my own tonight.	I'll be with you.	I don't want to go tonight.

Coffee?	Sure.	I'll do it.
Are you okay?	I don't think so.  I feel.  I feel a bit funny.	Let's go for a walk.
Are you making an ass of yourself?	There's only you, Ryan.  You know what, Ryan?  You're beautiful.  I love you so much#  You need# 	I don't need a drug.
Jesus Christ, it's a fucking dog!	Don't go in, Ryan.	What?
Is there space here?	Yes.	Do you need anything else?
How's the movie going?  Your movie.  You are making a movie, aren't you?	Yes.  Fine.	That's it?  Yes.  Fine?
You don't need to do that.	I don't mind# 	Relax.  You've done enough.
Hey, slow it down, big boy.  You're making the rest of us look bad# How come I haven't seen you around here before?	I'm new# I was born yesterday.	Tell me about it.
Are you sure this is a real dance?	Well, actually, uh $  I'm sort of making it up $ 	Really?
What was that thing?	How should I know?	I order you to find out where we are!
Wear this.	You're a real buddy.	Yeah, I know.
I'm getting lonely.  Who are you talking to, anyway?	My mother.	That's sweet.  That's real sweet.
I hope everything goes all right.	I hope so.  Wouldn't you know they'd call me on a day like this $  with my cold and everything $   How do I look?	Fine.  Wait.
One more?	I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.	You're so right.
Your phone.	Oh.  Yes?  Just a minute.  If you don't mind $  this is sort of personal	All right. Have a nice Christmas.
You're in no condition to go anywhere $  except back to bed.	You don't want me here $ 	Sure I do. It's always nice to have company for Christmas.
Here. How about some breakfast?	No $  I don't want anything.	I'll fix you some coffee.
When are you coming home?	As soon as I can walk.	Something wrong with your legs?
I didn't mean it that way $  I was just talking to him on the phone $  he's very concerned about you.	He doesn't give a damn about me.	Oh, you're wrong. He told me $ 
I think I'm going to give it all up.	Give what up?	Why do people have to love people, anyway?
Are you all right?	Sure.  What's that funny smell?	Gas.  Didn't you turn it on?
Where are you going? BUD Who knows? Another neighborhood $  another town $  another job $  I'm on my own.	That's funny $  so am I.  What did you do with the cards?	In there.
On account of me.	You?	Who else?
Not so rough, honey.	Good night.	Good night?
Say, what's going on here, anyway?	Nothing.  Just clear out, will you?	My shoes.
Where do you live?	I told you $  with my mother.	Where does she live?
Charlie?	Looks that way.	Who's he?
Listen.	What is it?	Listen.
Hey, buddy, that boat still runs, eh?	Yeah, it still runs.	Do me a favor buddy, please.
No, sir.	This gentleman or myself ?	No, sir.
Do you?	Yeah, I like it# 	I love it.
You don't know how happy that makes me, sir.	Why?	Now I can get out a here $  if I can find a way out.
Who are you?	His name is# 	I'm not ever goin' to tell you to shut up again.
Told you I'm fine!	How many do you see?	What?!  Fuck off.  Save yourself.
I'm sorry.	Don't be silly. How bad?	Not bad.
What about your mother?	How do you know about my mother?	I hear you talk when I'm waiting!!!
Nice of you#  thank you.	Thank you.	Now I want you to do something for me.
Oh, I'm sorry#  Didn't I say, "what?" I thought I said, "what?"#  What?	I want you to go on this trip.	No, sir# 
Hello?	Are you still coming?	Yes.
I was going to do that for you.	It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?	I $  uh, I#  Well, there is no place cards or anything.
You wanna dance?	I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.	And?
I don't want to hear that music right now.	What do you mean? You said you liked it.	I don't.
Hello.	Yeah#  Well# 	How you doing?
I wasn't asleep!!	What a break# 	Is it a secret what you're doing here?
Do you want to know what happened with my parents?	Yes. I really would.	Well# 
You're taking him#   yes#   you're taking him $  this will clear the books. One night. You want to say "no" to me? Try#   because I've never felt as nuts as I do right this second. I almost want you to try saying "no."	I'm not saying nothing to you.	Thanks for looking after him.
What?	"What?" Look at you#  You sense a mark.	Hey $  you called me#  I# 
Is he dead yet?	No! Would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him?	Absolutely.
Did you#  do something to him?	Do you realize that I work at him?	No, I didn't.
Is there a problem?	No.  No problem.  The airport, right?	Right.
Where you from?	What is this?	Not too good at small talk, eh?
What are you doing?	Get out.  You think I'm running you up?  Get out.	You can't $ 
So what happens now?	We go around once.	Bullshit.
How'd you know?  Just tell me that. How'd you fucking know?	I knew the same way in ten years you're going to know.	What does that fucking mean?
Five million dollars?	That's right.	Shit.  That sure is a lot of money.
Did you see how I did that?  Magic wasn't it?	What?	You understand what's going on?  It makes sense, right?
How did he know?	Know what?	The fucking contract!  How in the fuck did he know.
Hello, Robert.	The contract?	Paid in full.
I know what happened.	I bet you fucking know!	It cost us.
What?	He has to clean up.  How many bodies were there?	Um, five.
I figure that means these are worth ten times that, maybe more.	Ten million $ 	Now you understand why I'm here.
Don't tell me I don't have a choice!	Right.	I'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why I shouldn't shoot you.
No.	Why?	Because I'm done.
I killed him.	Why?	Because that's how it works.  That's what it's about.  He was the best. He was on top.
It.  Tell it.  For all I know it could be a machine.	You said you didn't trust it.	I don't.
Hey, where are you?	Thinking.	About?
That's where he'll be.	What?	I wasn't expecting this.  I need to think.
Do you think about the game?	Yes.	But you've never figured out a way to win.
You should knock.	Sorry.	How was the beach?
What is it?  I don't like this at all.  What is going on here?	I don't know.  It just happened.  I was here ten years ago, I'm here now.  That's it.	I don't believe that.
What are you doing?	What?	That's a ridiculous move.
Do you ever think about starting over?	All the time.	Can you tell me about it?
I think I've heard of you.	It's possible.	You're pretty famous aren't you?
Can I ask you something?	Go ahead.	What do other guys do?
It must be on the other side of this.	But how did the wall get here?	I don't know. This wall isn't like the rest though, it's not all that old either.
I'd love to get in there.	Don't we have enough already?	It must be fair old size, suppose it's empty?
Perfect!	It looks new, they might miss one or two.	We're going to need it all.
Afternoon!	Am I late?	No, not if you've got better things to do.
I don't understand, it's your home?	There's nothing there for me.	I'm sorry about what I said, really I am. Just take me with you, I don't care where.
I'll do my best. Is the place open.	Yep, it's all yours.	Okay.
What would you like, beer?	No, just a coffee.	One beer, one coffee, thanks.
Better than you.	Hmm, I still owe him.	Why don't we both forget about him?
This is your doing?	Yes, they had nothing to do with it.	And you broke into that room?
Great, let's break for lunch and I'll buy you a beer on the way.	But I have to finish this# .	Come on, that shit can wait.
When the hell did you write that?	Just yesterday.	Shit Honey, you could've told me. People might think it's about us!
Yeah, so I hear. Don't you think you should go get changed?	Later.	Okay honey, but don't be long. I got plans.
That's my bag.	Go to hell!	It's more than what you're worth.
Will you come home and forget all about him?	Yes, if you can get him free.	Alright, I'll see to it and things'll be just as they were, okay?
So go dance.	With you.	I. Don't. Dance.
Your father dropped off an extra check.	I don't want his money.	It could help with a new car $ 
What are you doing here?	He wants to talk to you.	Now it's okay?
He goes to my father's church. He could've died $ 	$  This your idea of small talk?	I don't make small talk $ 
Yeah.	Why?	Because that's where the fire is?
So what else is on this list?	It's private.	You want to tell me# 
Because I try to be nice to people?	Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.	Do you think I'm strange?
You're really into God, right?	In ten words or less?	Yeah.
Oh. Just not at school# 	Yeah $ 	Or anywhere where people might see us.
So it's like you want to be secret friends.	That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind $ 	Then maybe you can read mine.
All of it.	It's not.	Prove it.
Okay. Maybe some of that is true $ 	You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend $ 	I don't want to be just your friend $ 
Like fire.	What?	You.
Yes. But not as a date date.	Why not?	I'm not allowed to date.
Your turn.	No.	I know you want to.
It's places like this that make me certain there's a God.	You're sometimes not sure?	I'm sure. Pretty sure.
You make me feel# 	Loved?	That. And less strange.
Come on.	Where?	Away from here.
Nope.	Anything you want.	Nothing.
What are you thinking?	That I want you to take me home.	Now? We just $ 
I'm asking how much.	Dad $ 	It's time to tell him.  It would be the right thing.
You've been well?	Yes. You?	Getting by.
How was school today?	Fine.	Learn anything?
George! He's supposed to ask you to the dance!	But he didn't ask me.	But he does! Don't you see?
Did you ever consider that some doors are locked for a reason?	Nope. The way I figure it, doors are made to be opened. See you after school.	Oh $  Marty $  what time did you say it was?
Look, maybe I'd better talk to Dick. Is he around?	Dick? Dick who?	Now who's being stupid? The guy who runs this place.
You promise to stay down there for an hour?	Yeah.	You expect me to believe that?
Sure is pretty.	What'd you come out here for?	I wasn't aware there was any law against it.
You know, before I met her, nobody could ask me how I was doing with my girl. Matter of fact, I didn't really have one.	Is that right?	Yeah.
Hi.	What're you doing?	I've got a gun here, sir. It's always a good idea to have one around.
What for?	For coming onto my property#  With a gun.	No, you're not either.
You still in school?	Nah, I got me a job.	Doing what?
Well, I know what my daddy's going to say.	What?	Can I be honest?
Hi.	Well, stop the world.	Quit my job.
What a nice place.	Yeah, the tree makes it nice.	And the flowers#  Let's not pick them. They're so nice.
I came in the front.	How bad off is he?	I can look and see.
Listen, maybe we ought to tell somebody about this.	You said that once already#  Too late now.	Why?
How you doing?	I'm fine. Kind of tired.	Yeah, me too.
Think I got 'em?	I don't know.	Well, I'm not going down there and look.
Don't.	Anybody ever done that to you before?	No.
What?	Nothing#  I was just running off at the mouth#  as usual.	I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.
Have you got a better idea?	I just don't want to go.	What?
What's that?	Well, I'd like to leave a message, if that's okay.	Sure.
Hi.	Yes?	This your place?
Morning#  Say, you got any gas?	Maybe.	Well. I'm sorry, sir, but we've got to ask you for it.
See, we're about out#  been driving all night. Actually, I don't even have time to explain it to you.	Well, matter of fact, I don't have any.	Just a second now. That's your truck. isn't it?
Was she pretty?	Who?	The girl I remind you of.
I hope these are your shoes.	Hi, Charlie.	Because that would mean they gave you mine.
Big fuckin' deal.	You want my partner to kiss your ass?	Would that be good enough for ya?
Where were you tonight?	Home. Watching TV.	All night?
Yeah, I was drinking.	When did you start drinking again?	A couple days ago.
You okay?	Yeah.	You don't look so okay.
What is your problem?  I'm trying to help you.  Why won't you let me help you?	I don't need any help.	Yes you do.  Something's on with you.  You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
How long were you having sex with him?	About a year and a half.	Were you with him last night?
Do you have a cigarette?	I don't smoke.	Yes, you do.
How do you know all this stuff about me?	You know all about me.	I don't know anything that isn't police business.
When did you write it?	You mean did I write it before my parents died?	Yes.
You're not going to stop following me around now just because you're on leave $  are you?	No.	Good.  I'd miss you.  You can get into trouble, though. You're not really a cop anymore.
No.	No?	No more games, Nick.  I'm tired of playing games!
You still think I kill people, don't you?	No.	Liar.
How'd you get in here?	I decided to give you one more chance.  I missed you.	You didn't not see me long enough to miss me.
I have to do some research tomorrow.	I'm very good at research.  I'll help you.	No thanks.
Easy there, partner $  I wasn't there.	I went over last night, too.	I wasn't there last night, either.
I'm not afraid of her.	Why the hell not?	I don't know.  I'm just not.
You know that stuff they say about how you can judge people by their friends?	I don't believe it.	Why not?
Is this finished yet?	I don't know.	When's your show?
These are great.	Aren't they?	How much for these five?
It's Andy again.	Still not here.	In this corner?
She's good.	I guess it was a long time ago.	Come on, let's get out of here.
Sit down! You're gonna fall out!	Me fall? Let's get some drugs!	Drugs??!
No, don't tell me you just got fired by your crazy boss.	I guess you did.	Guess I just got sick of him.
Hi.	Hi.	What's that?
That one's for you.	Thanks#  I'll take it tonight.	I can't. After the show.
#  Maybe I'll watch it on TV.	"We"?  You and# 	#  and me.  No, that's be me and me.  Is that what I said?
Let's make a deal.  Other than my blood, what can I off$ 	Sorry, Max.  A die for a die.	Either you've caught a cold, or you're planning to kill me.
It's good to see you.	What seems to be the problem?	Women.
You're not even listening to me.	What?  I'm sorry.  You were saying# 	We've been going out over a year now and# Okay, here goes.  Bruce, I want to spend my life with you.
The dreams again, sir?	I think they're getting worse.	It's a wonder you sleep at all.
Find anything interesting?	Why do I feel like the other man, here?	Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
How high up would you say that is?	I'd say about thirty feet, sir.	You know, if you cut your bathroom in half, you'd have my apartment.
Look! Police!	I know. I called them.	Shouldn't we $ 
I know it's late. I $  Are you there?	Yes, Bruce $  I'm here $ 	I'm sorry I had to stand you up today. I'd like to make it up to you.

You saved my $  uh $  life#  or whatever#  something.	Two hours.	What?
Oh, Adam, don't ever leave me alone.	You left me.	I know.  I'm sorry.
That little girl saw us.	She couldn't have.  We can't make them see us.	But she saw us.  I could feel it.
All right.  Who are you?	We're# 	You're the dead.
So#  You're ready for me now?	You've got to help them.	Can you help me?
You don't have a key?	Maybe Charles does.	I have a feeling there's some very interesting space behind this door.
I would like to walk today.	Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the President, aren't you?	Oh, really?
Will you be leaving now, Robert?	In a day or two, yes.	Eve is going to stay. The house will not be closed.

May I ask your name?	My name is Chance.	Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?
Can you see well?	Yes, very well, thank you.	Do you like it?
Do you need a doctor? I could call Robert# 	I don't want Robert.	I see.
We could do it now, we can go upstairs.  #  Please, it's time for us. Come upstairs.	I like to watch.	Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it alone?
Some pictures# ?	Yes. Of men and women.	#  Oh.
I don't think we should call anyone just yet, it may not even be all that serious.	I agree.	Let's have a look, do you mind?
Yes. It has.	#  You will honor me and my family with a visit, won't you?	Yes. I will.
#  Maybe you should talk to somebody, darling.	No, that won't do any good.	#  Is it me? Is there something I've done?
Ben!	#  Mr. President, how good to see you.	It's so good to see you too, Ben, you look terrific!
You're right, Mr. President I don't like feeling sorry for myself.	Take care of yourself, Ben.	You take care too, Bobby.
Yeah, just an idea I had.	She's very beautiful.	Just an idea I had.
Did you eat?	Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I didn't call. It was just, you know, hard to get away.	I was worried.
I have to go back.	Okay. Maybe tomorrow.	I have to go back now.
How was it?	I have to go back tonight. At eight Exactly.	Why?
You were him last night, weren't you?	Yes.	And he was with her.

WILL YOU STAY?	WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME WHO AM YOU?	I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU AGAIN.
You don't sit with me!!	Baby, don't be like that.	You don't sit with me!! I don't sit with people who leave me!
Your mother all right?	No. Not a bit all right. Hasn't gotten out of bed since that day.	You think I should stop by? Think she'd welcome it?
Yes?	May I come in?	What you want?
Should I wake her?	No, let her rest.	She likes to see you off in the morning.
This is hard for me. But I got to do it. Two things I got to say to you. I'm a take the easy one first.	If it's hard for you, might kill me dead. 	I come looking for you to ask your pardon. Apologize.

Shut the fuck up.  Hello?	Yeah?	Okay, listen$ 
Well?  Aren't you?	Well#  yeah.	All right, get out.  Both of you.
Thank you.	For what?	It would've been easy for you to let me die back there today, but you didn't.
You came back for me.	Did you think I wouldn't?	Took you long enough.
What do you think?	Sounds like a plan.	What do you really think?

Should we buy it?	Are you kidding?	We'll take it.
You wanna split?	Yeah, I don't feel so well.	Okay, guys, we're gonna leave.  Let's get the check.
What did I tell you?	It's great and everything, but what am I going to do with all this?	Sell it?

There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.	That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.	I know.
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.	That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.	I know.
Just low.	You loved her, didn't you?  You really loved her.	Yeah, Dad.  I really did.  What am I gonna do?
You mad at me?	Not mad.	Yeah, you are.  I can tell by the way you look at me.
You're like your mother.  You love money.	Dad.	No, it's good.  You have a family.  It's good if it makes you happy.  It's nice to have nice things.  Are you happy, son?
She's angry.  It's all over the news.	Yeah.  Listen.  I'm going to be going away for awhile.	You're not going to trial?
Hello.	Hello.	Do I know you?
You should have taken better care of me, you know?  You've been away a long time. Four years.  Say something.	What do you want me to say?  I'm in prison.  You should know.  You put me here.	Fuck you, George.  I knew you'd say something like that.  Always thinking about yourself.
Hey, look.  You start paying, who knows what will happen.  You're a good father, George.  I always gave you that.  But you've got to talk to her.	Yeah.	She's getting big.  Getting her own ideas.
I don't know.	Are we gonna split up?	No, never.  Don't even think about that, it's impossible.  I love your mother. And you are my heart.  Could I live without my heart?  Could I?
What are you doing here?	Nothing.  I just wanted you to know I was out.  I just wanted to see you.	Well, here I am.  See?
Let me ask you something.  If you could go anywhere in the world, anywhere, where would you want to go?	You mean, like a trip?	Yeah, sure, whatever.
I'm thinking about getting out of town this week.  You want to come with me?	Where are you going?	I don't know.  Maybe California.
I'm sorry, baby.  I'm so sorry.	It's alright, Dad.	I didn't mean to# 
But I haven't shot him.	You weren't able to. But what's important is that you tried.	What's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing.
About three hours.	Cause?	Not sure.  I'll have everything you need tomorrow.
Why did she say she was leaving?	She didn't.  She just left.	Why do you think she left you?
I heard him say it.	Then $  those are not your own words?	No.
I don't know.  I'm not sure.	Well, think about it.  Isn't it possible?	Yes.  I suppose it's possible.
Why not?	Because, I'm your attorney.  I shouldn't be going to your house.	Is it against the law?
Hello?	Hi.  It's Frank.	Hi, Frank.
Yes $  it would be nice.	What would?	You and me $  making love.
Michael $  get off the phone.	Why?	Because I'm expecting a call.
Frank $  I know you're busy, but Michael asked me after dinner if you were angry with him.  He wanted to know why you weren't talking to him.	I'll talk to him later.	Why don't you talk to him now?
Yeah $  what are you doing up?	We have to talk.	What's wrong?
Yes.	What time did you leave?	Six thirty $  and he was very much alive.
Yeah.	Michael.	What?!
What do you know about "the changes"?	Well, I didn't know they was a secret club.	Don't talk about what you don't know. Besides, she's too young for "the changes."
So, how long you've been living here?	Long.  You just got off the train and stayed without knowing anyone there?	Yeah.
Oh, that's nice.	Want another cigarette?	Sure.
And did you?	I'd like to think so. I know one of them went on to Medical school.	Why did you stop?
My mistake. I apologize.	What made you ask such a question?	I thought that's what we were doing $  asking questions.
It's Robert.	Oh, hi. Look, I'm running a little late, but I'll still# 	Listen, don't take this the wrong way but, I'm wondering if this is such a good idea.
You want to eat something?	Are you hungry?	No.
I don't know why I'm so tired all of a sudden.	Long day. Go to sleep.	Am I too heavy for you?
Sleep all right?	Yes, thanks.	Good. More coffee?  Robert, I hope you don't mind my asking, but I feel like I should.
No matter how I keep turning it around in my mind $  it doesn't seem like the right thing.	For who?	For anyone. They'll never be able to live through the talk. Richard will never be able to. He doesn't deserve that. He hasn't hurt anyone in his life.
What time is it?	Later. Go back to sleep.	Where you going?
Okay.	What's her name?	Betty.
About an hour ago.	They're not going to find her!	Yes, they are.
Is it true?	Yeah.  He lived there.  And died there, too.	Died there?  How?
Hey, kid.	Yeah?	Take my advice.  Get the hell out of there.  It's a bad place.  Always has been.
I ain't interested.  And if you gonna sell it, don't sell it round here.	Just try it.	I said, no thanks.
Where are we, baby?	Where we'll always be# 	But.
What it will be.	How did you get in here?	Time like this, is that what you really want to know?  How I got the fuck in here?
Are they on the radio?	Naw.  But they will be.  They're the best.	How do you know?
Careful.  That's bad luck.	That place is already bad luck.	Why?
I can't.  Not yet.	It's alright.  If you want to go home# 	No, I want to stay with you guys.  But I can't.  I mean I'm not ready.
You got the cash?	You got the shit?	Yeah, but you got to come the rest of the way on foot.  Leave your car and walk over here.
Let me see it.	Let me see it.	Where is it?
Why?  Why did you give a shit about the building?  Why did you care that we were there of all places?	It's# it's a bad neighborhood.  As you can see now.	Bullshit, Dad.  Don't front me.  For once.  Just tell me the truth.  I came from there, too.
That's right, I know.  I fucking know.	Know what?	Open the case!
How the fuck can I open it?	The same way you did before.	What are you talking about?
You don't think I'll do it, do you?	I think you're fucking crazy!	Where is it?
They were early.	What are you talking about?	They just left, didn't they?
You mean they weren't up here?	No!  They're still on their way.	That doesn't make any sense.
You can't leave.	The hell I can't!	I need you # 
It would have been so easy to let him in as you went out.	You don't, you can't believe that # 	I've seen the way he looks at you. He's always wanted you.  Maybe two million dollars finally bought you.
What are you doing?	We're going to need some time.	Who are you going to call?
We were in a car accident $ 	They were in a car accident.	But everybody is all right.
You can't kill me yet.	Why?	I could be lying.
See?  We're for real.	I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories.	You did the right thing.
Okay, one drink.	What do you want?	A beer?
I had to see you.	Look, I don't think this is a good idea.	I wanted to apologize.
You didn't have to tell me if you didn't want to.	I guess I wanted to.	I'm glad you did.
Yes there is.  I felt it this morning when I brought you the coffee.	Shit, here we go.	You didn't want to see me, did you?
The difference is, I can have sex with someone I just met, someone I hardly know, but to steal I need to know someone like I know myself.	Do you think you know me like that?	I think # 
He'll have to run.	If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money.	You'll be clean and we'll be rich.
Jesus, that's beautiful.	Thank you.	If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught?
I had a partner and she fucked me.	I won't.	I think we're going to find out.
Oh, thank God.	I'm still here.	I was so afraid you # 
Hey.	Hey.	How'd it go?
I will never understand it, Mickey. You didn't even call the police.	I told you, the family doesn't want the police around.  We want to take care of it ourselves and we will. I'll find him.  I swear I will.	I know you will.
$  he went inside! $ 	$  if we can get a clean shot $ 	$  inside the house? $ 
I won't ask again.	I work alone.  Like you#   # we always work alone.	What do you mean?
Was this a game or a fuck up?	I don't know.	Get the kids out!
So what's in Paris?	I want to go home.	For twenty thousand dollars.
I said ten thousand.	You have blood on your pants.	Okay.  Twenty thousand.  Ten now.  Ten there.
Look, I want a ride to Paris.  That's all I want.  I swear.	You swear?  That's great.  I feel so much better now.	I don't want anything but a ride. All I want to do is go home.
I needed a break.	Where are we?	We're about an hour away.
I should go.	I don't remember any of this.	Jason# 
Look, I don't know what's up there.	You got me pretty fucking curious.	Look, you could come up.  Or you could wait if you want.  I could go check it out.  You could wait.
It doesn't matter who you were before.  It's who you want to be. That's all that matters.  We have this money.  We have what we have.  I had nothing before and now, I don't know, maybe I have more, maybe it's nothing, but#   I say we leave here.  We leave this place.  We go until we can't go anymore.	You could do that?	Yes.  That's who I want to be.
What was I thinking, right?	I can't protect you anymore.	What about you?
Can I help you?	This your store?	Yes.
Where's the dog?	My husband's out looking for him.	He run away often?
What the hell're you talking about?	You're in danger.  All of you.  I have no time to explain.	Wait a minute $ 
Sam!	Jack!	Long time no see!
What's the matter?	Sorry. Nothing.  See you - I'm going to be late.	You are late.
Thanks, Jack. I'll be in touch.	Do you know what you're doing.	Trust me.
Jack, she's innocent!	Sam - we've always been close, haven't we?	Yes we have, Jack!
Jack?#  Jack?	Shut up!	Jack, I'm innocent! Help me.
You stupid bastard!	What?	How could you do this to me?
Bloody hell! Do as I say!	No.	Please!
You know, smoking's bad for you.	It's my fucking life.	Yes, of course. Sorry.
I was right! Step on it!	Let go! We've got to stop!	Now you're the one that's out of your mind.
Come on, let's go! Let's get out of here!	Oh God! What have we done?	We? Don't blame me!
They're gone.	Are you sure?	Yes.
That's it.	You are good to me Sam.	Don't mention it. See you later.
My mother said it would be all right.	She didn't say anything about it to me.	Well, she's my mother, not yours.
Sam!!! 	Mother? #  What #  what's #  you've got to help me # 	Not now #  please
Now look what you've done to him.	Have you got one or haven't you?	Not #  as such # 
You know each other a long time?	Two years. Ever since we left island.	In that time, you ever have sex?
Okay, what happened?	He's going to be all right, right?	No. He's dead.
You're not going to die.	What did you say?	Shut up. You're going to die and he's not. Got it.
Here, you try.	No, I'd better not.	Sure, sure, give go.
It's my first cigarette in over a year.	The first is always the best.	It's the waiting that's killing me, not knowing, you know? It's really hard on my mother. The doctor doesn't think my father'll make it. He says he was dead too long, after six minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes, close the door.
That boy you brought in, he was shot, wasn't he?	Yes.	He's dead, huh?
It's been bad lately, but it's always bad.	How long you been doing this?	Five years.
I shouldn't have asked you to come.	You asked me not to come.	Promise you won't go inside.
What is it? You want to help me, you feel sorry for me? Keep it to yourself.	I need to sit down a minute.	Or maybe you wanna fuck me? Everyone else has.
Who is it?	Frank.	Come on up.
It's coming.  Hold her down.	What's that, Frank?	Three legs.
Where you going?	I quit! I'm through!	You can't leave me now.
Mr. Oh.	It's early for him.	That's all right, we're not meant to do Oh tonight. Something is going to happen. I can feel it.
Turn it off.	What?	You know what. The radio.

Fuck you! Fuck you!	Yeah?	You know who you're fuckin' with?! Huh? Do you?!

I mean, listen, two people don't get along, at some point you gotta call it#  I mean, it's none of my business, but I #  I think that's what you gotta do. You gotta take it somewhere -	Oh, you're right, I know.  It's#  well, I was just -	What? What?
You did. I like that. I like that. That's what I like about you. You did the right thing.	I did what you told me to.	Yes, you did.

Yes!	Thank you. Very nice.	I told you I was hot tonight.
All right.	Okay?	Yeah.
So, it's gonna be okay, isn't it?	Promise?	God#  I wish you# 
What does that mean? No, I know that look. What does that mean?	It means I got the money.	You got money. That's a - That's a good look.
You're not gonna drive. Don't even think you're gonna drive.	No, I'm gonna drive.	No, I'm not gonna drive with some crazy -
There's more!	I think that's it.	There's more! There's a couple stuck in there. I know there's more.
Wow.	Boy, look at this place, huh?	Incredible.
How many of these you gonna eat, huh?	Two.	Two?
Give all the guys in your crew a piece of that?	I took care of everybody.	Yeah?
I do all the work. Somebody don't like it, fuck him.	It's up to you.	They want a fuckin' war, I'm ready.
Who's this guy? Who's this guy?	Oh, he ain't nobody.	You know what I want you to do? Get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the desert, then let 'em show you where it's at.
Whoa. Calm down.	Get out. Get out! Get out!	Take it easy!
No more fuckin' dirty work!	No, no, no, no!	Take him out! Take this motherfucker out!
Hey! Oh!	Oh, sorry -	What's the matter with you?
Hey, Captain God!	What did$ ?	You turned around!
Did you try to kill# 	What?	Nothing. How's your hand?
Hey Buddy!  Can you let me pull over?  Give me some space to pull over.	Where do you think you're going?	Any place.
What was that for?	You could've made me lose my call.	So what?  What could be important enough to put your hands on me?
Lady, try making some sense.	You may be our only chance.  I don't know if I can do this again.	What'd you do!  Just pick my number out of the air?
Now I have $  it's a long story.	Why didn't you just shoot them?	Because a lot of people would've gotten killed.  Probably all the wrong ones.
He had a gun.  I have it now.	Why are you telling him that.  Are you crazy?	The rest of the money is here in the car.  Why don't you come and get it?
Thank God $  thank God I've got you.	Who is this?	You mustn't hang up.
You're making it too easy.	You got time on your side.  Pretty soon they'll be missed and we'll have the law up our ass.	They saw you kill the driver.
Where do we meet?	It's a nice day.  How about the beach?	Pass.
How far off are you?	Five minutes.	Where do I turn?
Just cut his hair, you know.	Yeah?	What you think?
Saw that one.	What would you call it?	Now, that was a look.
You fucking promised.	Did I?	You fucking did.
Thank you.	Who the fuck is he?	Jimmy.
Look, I'm sorry.	Fuck off, Dave.	No, I won't fucking fuck off. Said I'm sorry, didn't I?
You American?	No.	Not English.
That should make her happy.	Who's she?	Don't know. Who is she?
You all right?	Yes, thank you.	What was that all about?
Now's the time you're meant to do something, isn't it?	Like what?	Make a pass or something. Isn't that the way it goes?
You got a special friend, Jimmy?	How special?	You want one?
Piss off, Dave!	Tough guy, huh? Are you going to be all right on your own?	I'm not on my own, am I?
Would you like a drink?	Yes, please.	What'll it be?
He was different.	How different?	As different as it's possible to be.
Do you miss him?	What do you think?	I think you do.
So what do you want with me, Jimmy?	Want to look after you.	What does that mean?
Even now.	No# 	He looks after me. He's a gentleman too.
You could?	Do you care, Jimmy?	Sure I do.
Kind of liked you as a girl.	That's a start.	So I'm sorry.
Do they know?	Know what, honey?	Know what I didn't know. And don't call me that.
Don't.	Sorry.	I should have known, shouldn't I?
Come on.	Why, honey $ 	Come on.
It's her, isn't it?	What's her?	She's the thing you had to tell me.
What you doing, Jimmy?	I'm not sure.	Do you like me even a little bit?
Why?	It's a secret.	You'd like me better that way, Jimmy?
So it's true, then?	What?	You like me better like this.
Why?	For me.	For you# 
So tell me.	I was trying to get out of something.	No! Tell me everything, Jimmy.
Why?	Got to be somewhere.	Try and go, then.
And you'll never leave me?	Never.	I know you're lying, Jimmy, but it's nice to hear it.
Promise?	I promise.	Where am I to go, Jimmy?
What was it?	You know her, Jimmy?	Jimmy, is it? Do you know me, Jimmy?
You were made for this.	Was I?	Perfect.
So he knows your name?	I told him.	Are you all there?
Why do you want to do that for?	Would make me feel better about it.	You sure about that?
So it was you all the time.	Who'd you think it was?	I thought it was Dave.
Eat something, would you?	Can't.	What do you mean you can't?
Hey $ 	What is it now?	You're going to have to do it, aren't you?
What makes you think that?	They're going to let that guy die. And you're going to kill me.	They won't let him die.
You make a nice couple.	Don't I know it.	So what were you fucking around for, then?
What the fuck am I doing here.	What the fuck were you doing here?	I got sent.
Where would you most like to be now, man?	Doesn't matter where.	Come on, man. If this shit was all over.
Help me.	How can I?	I don't know. Just help me. Give me a cigarette.
Go to sleep now.	I don't want to sleep. Tell me something.	What?
You stupid bastard $ 	What you say, faster?	I said you bastard $  stop $ 
Not here.	Who gives a fuck.	You never know.
Oh, you should see your face.	What about it?	It's lovely.
I said, tell me to go to the $ 	I heard you, I heard you.	Then say it.
I believe you.	Thanks very much.	Oh, you've got the money all right $  you just don't know you've got it.
Why not?	Because they're still here.	Oh.
It's Charles!	Very good.	He looks so young $  when was this taken?
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you the truth, but I had to find out your part in all this.	Alex $  how can you tell if someone is lying or not?	You can't.
What for? If it's not here, why bother him?	And if it is?	Why bother him?
What's going on?	Don't you understand French?	I'm still having trouble with English.
You haven't said a word since we left the club $  what happened back there?	I $  I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not.	I don't think I follow you.
We're here.	Where?	On the street where you live.
Lock the door and the window $  and don't let anyone in except me. I'll be back in a minute.	Be careful, Peter.	You took the words right out of my mouth.
Go on.	That's all.	No, it isn't $  where's the money?
No, they won't $  I won't let them.	Please help me, Peter $  you're the only one I can trust.	Of course I'll help $  I told you I would, didn't I? Come on now $ 
What'd he say?	He $  he said if I didn't give the money, he'll kill me.	I wouldn't take that too seriously.
Do you know him?	I've never seen him before.	He must have known Charles pretty well.
Hi honey.	What's wrong?	I have a question to ask you. A personal question.
You know her?	It can't be.	Who is she Daddy?
You fucked me up!	What?	You gave me a 'D'.
of COURSE. You're not scared?	Of course I'm scared.	Then you should go.
You can't tell your parents.	Ok.	Especially not your dad.
This place is empty.	Everyone's getting ready for the party.	You heard about that?
Cut it out.	Why?	I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
Who?	The men. Do any of them still live around here?	Two men left town right after it happened.
On what side of the family?	His mother's side.	His mother's an only child.
You ok?	Just thinking about something.	What?
What are you doing?	I got to go.	What?
You're so beautiful.	So are you.	Now don't be nervous.
What, do you work for my boss, dog?	Okay, okay.	At least somebody likes this shit.
Go on.	Would you hurry up, please?	Look, put this in the back.  Keep it safe.
Holy shit# 	# man!	Oh, shit.
I don't want you to come anyway. 	What?	Come on!
We're gonna die!	We're gonna die!	Hey, hey, hey.
What the hell?	What the$ ?	You've gotta be# 
What?	 	What?
Well, hell, the smoke's gonna kill us anyway!	 There's gotta be# 	# another way  outta here.    Hey.
Hang on, hang on.	Let's go!	Go.
Hey.	Hey, be cool.	Be cool.  Be$ 
Give it to me now, or you'll be dead# 	# within five minutes.	It's for you.
All right, gentlemen. We're about done here.  Fine job.	Thank you.	Your country and a lot of innocent people in it# 
Why?  You're a nothing, nobody!  Why?	You'd never understand!	I would've in another life.
Oh, caught a few, lost a few.	Story of my life.  Well, one thing you won't lose is that friend of yours back there, I'll tell you that.	Oh, no?
  All right.	I'll lead 'em out.	 
How much are you worth?	I have no idea. How much do you want?	I want to know what you're worth. Over ten million?
She's just no good.	What can I tell you, Kid? You're right. When you're right, you're right, and you're right.	Ain't worth thinking about.
You've done well by yourself.	I get by.	Well, sometimes it takes a while for a man to find himself and I guess you have.
I don't want it anymore.	No?	No. It was an accident.
What are you doing here?	Didn't you call?	How do you happen to know her?
I don't suppose you got any idea Where she went?	Matter of fact I do.	Where?
That's it?	Yeah.	Well, let's go.
Who is he, get his name? I'll kill him.	Take it easy, take it easy, it was an accident.	An accident?
No.	Do you know where she might be?	Certainly not!
Is there anything else you want to know?	Where you were when your husband died.	I can't tell you.
How did it happen?	Been meaning to talk to you about that.	Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?
Hold still. Why?	You can't always tell what's going on there.	# No. Why was it.
What's wrong?	Your eye.	What about it?
Where?	Just#  I have to.	And I want to know where.
Okay, give me the keys.	You bastard.	It's either that or you drive to the police yourself.
Just tell me the truth. I'm not the police. I don't care what you've done. I'm not going to hurt you, but one way or another I'm going to know.	You won't go to the police if I tell you?	I will if you don't.
Let me handle that.	I'm all right.	Sure, but I'd like to handle it.
That's exactly what we wanted to hear.	Oh, good.	I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?
You're a married man, am I right?	Yes# 	Hard working, have a wife and kids# 
The water.	What about the water?	When it comes.
No, really?	I'm afraid so.	I am sorry.
Did you ever see her again? 	No. And nobody knows where she is.	It was probably meant to be like this. Each of us has a star to follow. So now what are you thinking of doing?
Oh yes, there is.	I don't think so.  Are you coming, Charles?	No.
Get out, both of you!	Charlie, please don't -	What are you waiting here for? Why don't you go?
Yes -	As a matter of fact, I do sing a little.	Would you sing for me?
Charlie!  I said, what time is it?	Half past eleven.	I mean in New York.
You goin', Mom?	Your mother won't be going right away, Charles -	Where'm I going?
Say, Brad.  I've got an idea.	Yes?	I mean I've got a job for you.
First of all - 	What's wrong, Brad?	I'm drunk.
All right.	She's going to leave you -	I don't think so, Brad.  We've just had word that the President is out of danger.  It seems I didn't kill him after all.
Who told you you could sit down here?	Oh!  I thought maybe we could have a drink together?	Think again!
Are you sure?	Am I sure?	Are you sure?
Thanks. Have a good one.	Do you mind if I drink this here?	Sure. Go ahead.
When did you get back?	Just now.	My God. I haven't seen you since#  
Promise me it'll always be like that.	Like what?	When you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything.
I'm serious.	We didn't just have sex in the bathroom?	No.
What the fuck is this?! I want some service!	In a second!	Fuck in a second! This is#  Look at you! You can't even pass!
I could never reach.	Reach what?	You know.
What? What's with you? You haven't said anything for like twenty minutes. What the hell is your problem?	This life.	This life?
I threw out the stuff that got broken. The floor looks clean.	You need a ride?	Got one. Just pulled up.
Are you open?	Yes.	Just the paper.
Say, young fella, you know I hate to bother you again, but can I take a paper or something back there#  to read?  It usually takes me a while, and I like to read while it's going on.	Jesus#  go ahead.	Thanks, young man. You've got a heart of gold.
Here you go.	What's this?	A fine, for five hundred dollars.
I'm going with you.	Not on that leg.	Take the gun.
Two# 	That's it, you look like a professional.	Three# 
Four# five# 	Nice and easy# 	Six# 
Use your other hand!  Grab it!	Help me!  I don't want to die!	You're not gonna die.  Grab me with your other hand!
Go ahead, say it.	No.  I got lucky with the lights.	No.  You were right, I was wrong#   # Max.
Annie# it's Max.	Max# 	Max, the cab driver!
No.	Oh, my, yes.	Get outta here!  You and Louis?
What?	I think#   # I think you should get this gun out of my fucking face.	What?  What did you say?
I was with Max when he got the call.	And you came all the way down here to see me?	It's nothing.
I'm in town for a short time.	Try?	Of course!
Hi, Ma.	I've been calling and calling.	I got caught up at work.
You cool, Max?  Say "I'm cool."	You're cool.	No.  You say you're cool.
What are you doing?	It's a mess.	So?
Hands on the wheel.  Ten and two o'clock, like they taught you in driver's ed.	Why?	Because I have a gun and I say so.
Don't take that.  Tell him to shut the fuck up.	I can't do that.  He's the Man.  He'll fire my ass.	So what?
Let's go.	No.	What you mean, no?
Max?  What are you doing?	Leave me alone.	Don't even think you're walking away from me.
Show up for what?	She's in the hospital.	You go every night?
I never told her.	Why the hell not?	I, uh, I have some problems.
Are you crazy?!	The guy came right at us!	You turned up a one way street!
I was only going one way.	Drop me off here!	Look, I'm sorry $ 
I still don't see what it has to do with the President.	Do you still ride?	Not for years.
Hey#   I can't control it.  It's just, something that happened.	What is?	Love.
I won't be here when you get back, but I'll be in touch.  And thanks.	For what?	You saved my life.
Was that who I thought it was?	Uh huh.	Has this happened to you before?
Did you see the van back there?	What van?	Never mind.  You'd think I was making it up.
Are you okay?  I wish I hadn't told you what I did.  But I can't help the way I feel.  You don't hold that against me, do you?	No.  That wouldn't be fair.  Where are we going, Jerry?	It would be a lot easier for me to show you instead of tell you.  But first things first.
Jerry.  Please.  You don't understand.  I have to know.  It's all I think about.  Do you have any idea what it's like not to know?	Yeah.  I know what it's like.	Then tell me what happened.
I'm a very patient man.	That's great.  Good for you.	Who have you been talking to, Jerry?  Who else knows what you know?
Can I ask you something?	A dog bit it.	Excuse me?
Jerry told me he bit your nose.	And what did I say?	A dog.
I'm still listening.	Jerry is dangerous.  Jerry has killed $ 	I don't believe you.
So, you doing anything tonight?	Working.	Hmm, how about tomorrow night?
Do you believe me?	Yeah, I do.	I want to believe you, too.
You aren't staying?	This#  seemed best.	Right.  Well.
Please answer the question, Doctor.	Is it possible.  Yes.  But $ 	Thank you, Doctor.  Now $ 
Talk to him.	But what do I say?	Just be yourself, Captain.  Find out where he is.
I used#  I used to dream you were alive#  and then I'd wake up and lose you all over again.	I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.	Dad#  But tell me, how did#  I mean how can# ?
What# ?	I'm sorry.	What is it?
Then how come it ain't done yet?	I don't know, Boss.	You don't know!
What's the writing say?	Dear Boys. Playing it cool. Wish you were here. Love, Cool Hand Luke.	Oh my. Oh my#  Give it back here!
Stop that.	How about you tryin' to make me?	Oh for# 
He'll never make it.	What are you talking about?	He doesn't know when to give in. They'll kill him.
Oh, God.  I must have looked horrible.	No, dear.  You're at your best with a bag in front of your face.	I want to die.
I'm going to put a guard on your door.	One officer already got killed trying to protect me.  Please, just take it all away.  Leave me alone.	He won't.
I was.	I'm over here?  What's your name, Officer?	Michael Johnson.
Whatever it is, I'm gonna find out and sooner is a hell of lot better than later.	Well, there's something missing in there.  There was something around her neck when I came in there, but it's gone now.	Who came in after you?
What does he want from you?	Hard to say.	I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
What about this one?	You look beautiful.	Really?
How wonderful, darling.  What does that mean for you?	I'll be running it three days a week, and# 	Will you get time off to do that?
Oh no.	Paul could pop the question at any time.	Mom, please.
Don't take it personally.	You have no right, no right to take the worst thing that's ever happened to me and make it into some kind of game.	Stop acting like you're someone special. You're just like the rest of us.
For a price.	Good God.	A small price.
It's TV heaven.	I was tired of watching what everyone else wants to watch. Now we can watch two shows at once.	Let's try out the bed.
You've got to see the kitchen first.	Do you like it?	I love your apartment.
The store was busy.	You got wine. That's great.	Would you mind if we just called it an early night?
What is it? Are you OK?	Always the drugs.	What?
Silly?   Silly am I?	Michael, take it easy.	Silly, silly, silly.
I guess we need to talk.	I guess so.	It's hard to know where to start.
I sure know what that feels like.	And all the plans we have.	Yeah, the plans.
I'm sorry.     I didn't come here to blame you.	I didn't mean for any of this to happen.	Oh, God, Michael, I know.  Why does everything have to be so hard?
What are we going to do?	What do you want to do?	I know I don't want to lose you.     I don't think I could stand it.
Would that really be such a good idea for either of us?	Just promise me you'll be OK, OK?	I will. And you make sure you take care of yourself.
Of course not, no.  Is that why you're here?	I think we need to talk about some things.	Yes, I suppose so.
No.	Especially this last year.	Especially now.
Getting back.	I heard about your friend.	What?
Our relationship meant a lot to me, too, Paul. But it's over.  And Michael being in the hospital doesn't really change things.	I think I've heard this speech before.	I'm really sorry.
And for my help I would get what?	Half the tapes.	And the other half?
There's ten grand in here. It's yours. I'm going to call you again. There's one more thing I need you to do.	What?	I'll tell you when it's time.
They were all French guys.	French guys?    You mean like from France?	Yeah, French guys from France.
What do we do?	I was told to take what we have and go.	Go where?   The police are outside.
When we get to the next corner jump out.	I'm not going to leave you.	We both know I'm already dead.
It's good.	God, I want to go home.	Hey, you know you can't this in France.
Who is closer to the wall, Joey or me?	Get in the car.	Just tell me who's closer to the wall?
What happened?	They sort of got away.	I see. Well, get back out on the street and find them before I "sort of" kill you.
Anybody know about that car outside?	Yeah.   It's mine.	No.   It's mine.
Can't sleep?	No.	I'm sorry things went so wrong today.
What do you want?	What I've always wanted, to teach you.	All right.  If you can take back the sword in three moves, I'll go with you.
Keep it safe.  Return it to me when we are together again.	I will.	If you don't, I'll come after you. And I won't let you off so easy.
My name.	I'm sorry as hell, man.	Thirty hours.  A day of life, plus change# 
Mom $ ?	I told you you're not supposed to come in here.	I lost my key.
Do you feel okay.	No.	You gotta go now, I bet.
I know your friend, too $  the one that looks like a rock star.	I don't know you.	I'd like to get in touch with him.
I've got him if you want him.	No shooting.	Move in, guys.
Are you okay?	I'll be fine.	Well, I'll leave you alone now. I just came in here to get something of mine.
You promise not to say anything?	On my mother's life.	Okay# 
So what year are you going into?	Junior.	Got a boyfriend back home?
Need a lift?	No thank you.	How are you today?
No, not at all.	Well, I was just calling to see how you're doing.	I'm#  I'm alright.
Well, I was just calling to tell you I was thinking about you and I miss you. I'll let you go.	Wait, don't hang up.	Okay?
It's weird. I actually feel good about myself. Can we do this again next week?	Oh please.	What?
That's okay. It doesn't make you a bad person.	Yes it does.	No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being honest with me.
You know what? I don't take it back.	Why are you doing this?	Because I'm in love with you.
Listen to me. Your mother must never know. Never.	Okay.	Did you hide the letters?
Calm down. Tell me what's wrong.	Something awful happened last night.	What do you mean?!
Excellent.	You think he'll like it?	He'll love it.
I'm sorry that was out of line.	I want to go home.	I was just kidding.
What are you doing?	You promised to let me kiss you.	But -
You think?	Is it me?	No, you were fine.
Where are you going?	I'm taking a shower.	Need any company?
Shut up.	What's your problem?	Nothing.
Morning!	Morning.	So? How'd it go last night?
Get off me!	Will you calm down?	Fine! Get off me!
I got your message and came as quick as I could.	I hope I didn't keep you from something.	Not at all. What's wrong?
Let me get that for you.	Oh please. I can't have you do that.	It's the least I can do.
I'll do that.	It's really important.	I understand. Good night.
Did I ever tell you the time when my late husband sent me -	Yes, you already did.	I did?
What time is it?	Eight o'clock. You got to go.	Did she show up?
Wow. I never knew she had these kind of feelings.	You're a lucky guy.	She really loves me.
Mommy $ 	Yes, darling.	Did you ever make a wish?
Where'd you get this, darling?	It was right there on top. Isn't she pretty?	She was very pretty.
What do you want. Amy?	I wanted to talk to you,  I wanted to tell you about the other children.	Can't you tell me later?
What do you mean you didn't play with the other children?	It was on account of the birthday party.	Because you didn't ask them?  I don't blame them for being angry. Why didn't you explain what happened?
Now Amy	It's true.	And who did the voice belong to?
Daddy!	Yes, Amy?	Why, daddy, you know my friend too!
She's there, just like I said she'd be.	Where, Amy? Where do you see her?	Don't you see her?# Right there, under the tree.
You mustn't be afraid.	But she's dead!	Amy, listen to me. Death isn't such a terrible thing.
You?	Yes, Amy.	But why?
I think she broke the skin.	What a bitch. You should see a doctor. That can be dangerous. George bit me once and I had to go to the emergency room.	George bit you?
So did you do it?	Did I kill him? Of course not!	No, did you fuck him?
Is it that funny?	No, it's just#  no one's ever said that. And I thought if someone did ever say it, I'd have to say it first and then they'd sort of say "I love you too" cause they felt they had to after I'd said it.	Is that how you feel?
How do you know?	I don't think you would. No matter what form you take.	I can't take that chance#  I couldn't live with myself if I did anything to you.
I ate a guy last night.	And how did you feel when you ate this guy?	I don't know. I don't remember doing it.
Yes#  I#  we had dinner.	Did he come home with you? Did you go to his apartment?	No, it was our first date.
Police.  Nobody move.	He tried to kill me!	Shut up!  Everybody stay calm# 
Who is it?	Won't say.  Says he must talk to you.	Put it through# 
Why give yourself up?	I  -  ah - couldn't think of anything else to do.  I thought maybe you know something#   I'm scared.	That was a pretty good escape act at the station.  How did you do that?
People#   after me.	Who?	I don't know who they are.
Look!  This is a good one!	What is that door?	Which one?
You see it?	Yes.	Where does it lead?
Bad dreams?	Yes.	Tell me about them# 
If you like.	You're supposed to be my doctor, right?	That's right.  I am your doctor.
What are you doing?	I have to go# 	You can't go yet.  We've got so much to talk about# 
You're a liar!	No, it's the truth.	So you're telling me the truth this time?  Is that it!
I thought it would make more sense. I'm getting the pieces, but when I put it together it feels like#  Like you're telling me about somebody else's life# 	It's the truth#   I need you.  I know you're innocent.	How do you know I'm innocent?
What about the wife?	Clean.	Check his kids.
What are you gonna do?	I'm going to kill him.	You can't kill a President.
I'm serious, Dave $  you could get in a lot of trouble for something like this.	It's fine.	They could put you in jail.
Thanks. You did great.  Maybe later you could come back and we could go to Camp David or something.	That'd be great.	Well $  take care.
No.	I'm afraid so.	Really?   Crazy?
You know, on an empty road where you know it's safe and nobody's around# 	I'm not sure#  I might have.	Well,  let's say your mother was in the car and you had to get her to a hospital.  You'd do it then for sure wouldn't you?
Oh#  Hi.	Dirty business we're in sometimes.	Yeah.
So, how long have they been like that - - you know, him and the First Lady?	I can't say.	You mean you don't know or like $  you can't say.
So you just protect the President the whole time?   That's your whole job?	Yeah.	You got a gun?
That was quite a thing you did today.	Anybody would have done it.	Oh, I don't think so.  Still, you helped a lot of people.
You're leaving?	I'm not the First Lady, anymore.  I shouldn't be here.	Where are you going?
You don't have to keep walking with me.   I'm okay from here.	I don't mind.	Thanks.
So what do you do the rest of the time?	You mean when I'm not running the country?	Yes.
You know, Dave $  it is Dave, isn't it?  I can't keep all of this a secret.	I know.	But you could go to jail for it.
What?	I can't.	I know. I'm sorry# 
I never thought I'd# 	I know.	I missed# 
Did you get someone to double for me there, out front?	We're working on it.	Try to find someone who looks like me this time.  That last guy was a joke.
You fired that shot, didn't you?	No, sir.	Let me see your weapon.
Of course I know you!  From the first time I saw you, I knew you had a wonderful soul.	Just like that?!  You just knew?	Of course just like that.  That's how you always know when it's right.
Oh Captain, My Captain, we came here so I could talk to you about something.	Okay.	Actually, I'd like to talk to you alone.
So what do you think of my father?	I'll take him over mine.	What?
I've found it.	Found what?	What I want to do!  Right now. What is really inside of me.
Visit from my father.	Do you have to quit the play?	I don't know.
You the Captain?	Yes.	How do we get out of here?
Now look what you did!	I saved your life is what I did!	Who asked you to!
Got it?	Hey! I didn't have to come back.	Yeah you did# 
Three minutes# I'm not back# no matter what# you go# 	No# 	You don't take orders very well, do you?
Shut up! You hear me!!	# we gotta get outta here $  NOW.	Shut up, man, just shut the hell up! I gotta think! I gotta think!!
What did you do the my kids!!	Me??	No! The man in the moon!! Who's driving this thing?
Joey# it's okay# 	What? You don't think I can have a normal life?	Joey# look at me# 
I'm telling you, man, we got to give the future some serious thought.	I have been.	And what have you come up with?
Was it the water in my eyes or were you guys about to# 	Joey# 	Because it's cool, you know, I can always take a walk or something down the beach# 
What was that?	Nothing.	Someone's back there.
She fucked you?	She fucked me.	She fucked me too.
She fucked us both.	Yeah.	Fucking women, man# 
This is it. Definitely. This is it, but they changed it.	You're full of shit.	Who's full of shit?
What the $ !	It's Nick!	Nick# ?  Jesus, Nick!
He's real bad, Nick.	Well, where the hell is he!!! I mean what are we all sitting here for!!!  WHAT THE HELL IS THIS???	Nick# 
You're back.	Yeah.	I'm glad. Seriously#  I'm very glad.
Did you ever think life would turn out like this?	No.	You know what Sal's got now?#  Sal's got#  one arm, Nick, and#  that's it.
I have to go.	But you must come in.	No, I $ 
Rough, huh?	Rough.  We didn't have to do it, John.	No?
Sal.	Talked to Sal?  Sal's alive?	Kind of. You didn't know?
Why?#  What do you mean?#  Why???	Nick, she won't say why.	But Sal's mother! What about Sal's mother!
I thought#  Oh, Nick, I thought you were hurt, some accident. Maybe you fell or maybe some car#   I thought someone stole you away!	No.	Oh, Nick! Oh I missed you so!
I'm just so lonely.	C'mon. I've got the car.	I'll be out#  Just leave me. I'll be out. I'm fine. Really. I'm fine.
You can do it, Sal.	No. No, no.	Sal#  listen to me, Sal! You have to do it.
I just wait. You know?	Huh?	I just wait. For this#  It's what I wait for#  I wait all year.
Is he from here?	Hell no!	Well, where's he from?
I'm telling you, Nick, no one's going to come.	What are you, God?	Listen, asshole, it's up to us!
Don't worry what it says in the book.	Right.	Just forget that. Forget what it says in the book.
Sal? Sal, it's me, Nick.	Nick. Hey. How's things?	Oh. You know. How's it with you?
Sal, we need you. We need you.	Hey, Nick. How can you need me?	We do, Sal. We do#  You're the heart.
Need help?	I got it.  I got it.	You sure?  I can help you.
They're going to rob that bank.	How do you know?	Some things never change.
You all right?	Yeah.	Seat's too high.
Funny.  Would you like to buy me a drink?	This little thing says I can't.	You could always take it off.
I see why you're here $  you knew that nobody was coming.	I didn't.	You're lying.
You're not $  Dorothy.	No. She's gone.	She couldn't be gone!
What's the matter with you?	You are afraid!	Afraid #  of what?
But I'm glad to be home again $ 	Tired?	Worried!
What's happening?	They don't look happy# something's gone wrong.	The police# ?

Yeah.	What are you doin' in there?	Who's this?
Right $  got ya.  Okay, so there's you $  what's your name?	What do you want to know that for?	Give me a name, any name, just so I got somethin' to call you.

Let's go to the back door.  How'd that guy get to be a guard?	Well, they go to guard school.	To what #  learn how to shoot? They don't get a gun.
I'm okay #  I'm okay # 	You know more than the Doctor? You're not okay, look at you.  Come on #   #  let's get him out # 	I'm not going.  I'm okay.
How did you know your son was involved?	It was on the TV.	When was the last time you saw Sal?

Excuse me?	Come over around seven.	O'clock?
HARRY? Are you okay?	Are you kidding? I couldn't be more okay.	My mom wants to know if you can stay for dinner.
Is it true what you said to Captain Rob?	Yes, Harry. I can't home school you anymore. So maybe it's time to make some new friends, some friends your own age# 	I'm just not ready.
Oh, yeah. Well I almost always beat Captain Rob.	Who's Captain Rob?	Just a guy I hang out with.
Whoa. What was that?	What?	Your mom made a move on me.
HARRY.	You look familiar. Did I have your brother?	No.

I heard you like to shoot dogs.	Dogs got no reason to live.	Oh?  you feel that way about people, too?
How was I?	Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best.	You sound like you mean it.
And you were the last one to talk to him.	Yes.	What'd he say to you?
You've got it on tape?	Clear as day.	Who else have you told?
You knew the deal. No contact.	Who was that other guy?	One of many people who would live a word with you.
What if I find out what they're after. You know these people, I don't.	And you won't. Now move$ 	I'll pay you.

Does that hurt?	Well# yeah.	Good.
Good. You're just what I need right now.	You got a minute?	It's really not a good idea for me to be seen with you.

Fuck you. When you needed information, I got it. You didn't care how.	I did care how.	This conversation's over.
He didn't give me$ 	$ otherwise we may have to$ 	Otherwise you may have to what?
He's kidding.	Where's mom?	She's in the kitchen.
Dad!	Do I know you?	Where've you been?
Bobby? Piece of advice?	Yeah?	Turn yourself in.

Excuse me -	Yes?	Can I ask - my friend, can he come in? Just for a few minutes?
He's gone, hasn't he?	No.  He's - no.	Oh God.  Oh God.
They've never caught him before, what makes you think they'll catch him now?	You got a better idea?	Yeah. Me.
We've got to catch him in the act.	Why didn't I think of that?	It's not the thinking of it, it's the doing it.
I have a question# 	Who am I?	That is of no interest.
You have a car?	Uh, yes.	Meet me in front. Five minutes.
I didn't expect you to be so# 	So what?	So alive.
Do you mind?	You# you can't.	Of course I can. I have a note from mother.
And I thought we were getting on so well.	We were, we are, but this is perfect for you.	Not interested.
We going somewhere?	Possibly.	Maybe I should drive this time.
He says they turned the card down.	Damn, I knew I forgot something.	Not funny.
What the hell was that?	Not bad. I didn't expect you to make it out.	You what$ ?
I don't believe this.	What's your problem? I'm doing the job.	What's my problem? You want a list?
Lose something?	I'm just curious what sort of security system you'd have in your own house.	And$ 
And good morning.	Good morning.	Nice spot.
STOP! You're making# mistake.	It's your mistake.	The big job.
Come on.	No way.	Go!
You two make quite a couple.	We're supposed to.	You better not be taking on a new partner.
See you.	Probably not.	Yeah. Probably not.
What the hell is this doing here?	It's those files you asked for.	I didn't mean for you to leave them in the middle of the floor.  Jesus.  Look at me. What do I have this afternoon?
The judge came up with a number.	A number for the whole group, or for us?	Both.
Oh, my God.	And he's making them give five million of it to you all.	Five million dollars?
I can put them in a good school.	Any school you want.	And get someone to help around the house.
You do know how to do that, don't you?	Yeah.  I got it.  No problem.	Good.
You're a girl.	Excuse me?	How come you're not at lunch with the girls? You're a girl.
I want my fucking money $ 	I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to put you on hold for just one second here $   Do you mind?	Yeah, I mind.  You bet your ass I mind.
Because that's how people treat each other!	Not in my world.	Gee, I wonder why.
I don't know what to say.	Say you were wrong.	I was wrong.
But I know you're not gonna quit on me.	How do you know that?	Cause you got a little voice in your head saying, do the right thing.  Give him another chance.
Look, I know you're mad.  But the way this job is, things come up at the last minute, real important things, and I gotta deal with them.  Now I don't like me missing dinner any more than you do, but we're all gonna have to get used to it, cause the fact is, it's gonna happen sometimes.	It happens all the time.	That's not true; we had dinner together just last night.
What are you doing?  Where's George?	I don't know.	George!
You want my number?	I do.	Which number do you want, George?
No.	C'mon.  I bought 'em for you, to make up for that night.	Return 'em.  Maybe you'll get your money back.
I'm not gonna leave my kids with you.	Why not?	Cause I don't even know you.
You mind telling me what that's supposed to mean?	Nothing.	If you got a problem with me taking care of your kids instead of getting some job, just say so.
That's Ed.	Lock the door.	No, I wanna say hi.
What's going on?  What are you doing?	Thinking.	About what?
Sir, I was wondering # 	Sit down, and shut up!	It can wait.
Sorry, Captain, being held by you isn't enough to get me excited.	Well, I hope you don't expect more.	I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.
Where are you going?	I have this #  feeling.  I'm not sure, really # 	That's just great.  Why doesn't everyone just take off?
May I say something personal?	Please	I like you.
Stop the damn car.	No way.	I said pull over.
Don't follow me.	You need help.	Like hell I do.
How? Where?	In the great book.	What book is that?
I'm gonna miss you.	Me too.	Sure you won't change your mind?
Excuse me Miss?	What!	A man to see you.
Do you keep any drugs in your house?	No. Of course not, nothing like that.	Are you sure?
Wanna drink.	Please.	What do you drink?
No it's alright I'll take it straight.	Are you sure?	It's fine really, sit.

By the way, we gotta go see Ma tomorrow.	No thanks.	No, I mean it.
I made her nervous.	What do you mean?	Her hands.  Like that.

You saw wrong.	Huh?	He's with the hotel.  I called him.
We're not getting paid then.	No.	Nothing. We get nothing.
When?	When we know.	Don't leave a girl hanging. Second rule of show business.

If you ask me, this is pretty stupid.	Just look.  What do you wear? A nine?	A seven.
Hey, pal.  I don't know about you, but where I come from there's a little girl's room and a little boy's room and the little boys don't go where the little girls go.	All right, but make it quick.  Shoes!  What size do you wear?	Nine.

Go on, Adam #   I'm not asking you for anything $  I was never even going to tell you. But hell, I never thought I'd see you again, either.	How old is he?	Five.  No one knows you're his father.  I thought someone might want to hurt him $  just to hurt you.

You've got someone in your office.	Get rid of them.	The Admiral?

Feeling better?	Yes, thanks.	That's good.  That's uh# good.
Uh, Sue# ?  I can't.	What?  What do you mean you $ 	Sue# look at your hands.
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?	That's what we're here to find out.	If it happened to him, then it could# 
Please don't make this personal $ 	Oh, I think you already have.	Victor, we can't do anything until the research is ready.
Just one, General# 	Yes?	Where can I get a cab back to town?
Sorry we had to get you up at this hour, Mr. Grant.	I thought I was on my vacation#  What's it all about?	I can't tell you.
You, uh#  I'm sorry, sir, but -	I decided not to - I'm, uh, not taking the trip as it turns out.	I'm sorry, sir, we do have to charge you the four dollars.
# So I guess that's it, then.  Here's the keys -	No, that's not it, Jerry.	Huh?
Well, it's all just part of this - they don't know I need it, see. Okay, so there's that. And even if they did, I wouldn't get it.  So there's that on top, then. See, these're personal matters.	Personal matters.	Yah. Personal matters that needn't, uh -
Both of these.	Oh, no, I can't let you do that.	Oh, don't be silly.
# Well, that passed.	Yah?	Yah. Now I'm hungry again.
Uh-huh.	We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there.	And his wife?
No.  I found something new.	Really, what's that?	The first rule is#  you aren't supposed to talk about it# 
I#  I don't know.  I guess#  when people think you're dying, they really listen, instead# 	$  Instead of just waiting for their turn to speak.	Yeah.
What are you doing here?	What#  ?	What the hell are you doing here?
Where?  Here?	Here.	There?
Make sure.	Okay.  Okay, I'm sure.	You feel nothing?
What is this?  Who did this?	#  A person.	Guy or girl?
There's a part of you I really like, but I can't do this anymore.  I just can't.  This is killing me# 	I'm sorry, but I# 	What?!  You're sorry?  I don't believe that for a minute.
How have you been?	#  You know me?	Is this a test, sir?
I guess so.	And, now it's gone.	All gone.
Insurance'll cover it.	Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list.	What list?
I don't know about this.	I don't know, either.  I want to find out.  I've never been hit, have you?	No.  That's a good thing, isn't it?
How do you feel?	Strange.	But a good strange.
If you could fight anyone#  one on one, whoever you wanted, who would you fight?	Anyone?	Anyone.
If you ever say anything about me or about what happens here in this house, to her or anyone $  I will find out.  And you'll never see me again.  Promise me.	Okay.	Promise you won't.
I don't know!  Nothing!	If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?	I would feel nothing about my life? Is that what you want to hear?!
This conversation# 	#  is over.	#  is over.
People think that you're me, because you and I happen to share the same body.	What#  ?	Is this really news to you?
Can't you call it off#  ?	It's out of our hands.  This is it.	Please# 
Why#  why#  why#  ?	Why what?	Why can't I get rid of you?  Why can't I just wish you away?
What are you doing?	What have you left for me?	Why do you want to do that? Why do you want to put that gun in your mouth?
Do something for me.	What?	Appreciate something.
He don't own this place, I do.  How much money's he getting for this?	There is no money.	Really?
We had a fight.  Some things got broken, the dog went crazy, she left me.  Wouldn't say where she was going.	What was the fight about?	Take a guess.
Can I ask you a question?	Sure.	When I die.  Is it gonna hurt?
I know it's crazy, but I'm really scared for the others.  I've got this terrible feeling.	What feeling?	That it's not over yet.
Is that something you're "feeling?"	I don't know. I wish I could just see him#  one more time, then, maybe#   I would know.	Then, let's go see him!
Knock it off!	May as well go out under my own free will, right?	Not with us in the fuckin' car!
You guys are real#  aren't you?	Huh?	Sorry, I mean#  I talk to people all the time#  I know a lot of them aren't there.  But this is real, isn't it?  You're taking me home now?
I'm getting him out.	What?  Are you crazy?  We're supposed to take pictures and split. You're gonna blow the whole program.	You never been in one of those things.
Stay on your heading, Captain.	Sorry, Sir.  Can't do it.	That's an order.
Hello, John.	Colonel.	Mind if I sit down?
I wanna go# Just let me go# 	Uh# Where# where do you want to go?	A real nice place I know#  Ah# can't get there! Not tonight.
Your name was picked.	Well, I don't understand.  What did you do $  did you pick my name out of a hat or#  or#  a list?	A list.
Now what?	Uh#  you#  you can pick out up to ten movies# 	Free?
Do you know what the Little People just told me?	The Little People?	They said you're The One.
But I gave it to you!	Well what am I gonna do with it?	I don't know. But I gave it to you# to help YOU# not him.
Listen, he just needs to sleep it off. Someone will take care of him.	Who?	Well, maybe he wants to stay here.  Do# do you want to stay here?
Tell me more. I want to know everything.	There isn't any more to tell.	Don't say that.
Excuse me# 	Listen, I'm not feeling well.	Well, no wonder.  We just met, made love and broke up all in the space of thirty seconds and I can't even remember the first kiss which is the best part.
Can I get you anything else?	No. How much do I owe you?	Five'll do it.
Robert# 	Very nice.	I have to talk seriously with you# 
Yeah#  I guess so# 	I'm going back up tonight. Will you go with me?	No# 
Maybe you better stay, then.	No, I need to talk to you, about so many things# 	Well, I'll be seeing you in a couple of days, won't I?
Oh God, I'm so glad, Robert, that you're coming# 	Yeah, me, too# 	It'll be so good for you, and for Daddy, because you know, you've never really# 
Look at that.	Why are you being so mean?	I'm not. He does walk funny. Don't you see that?
After that, I plan to read some music and rest for awhile.	Tomorrow, then.	Tomorrow's a full practice day#   But the day after is kind of open.
That was beautiful, Robert. I'm surprised# 	Thank you.	I was really very moved by the way you# 
Robert?	What?	I could spend some time with you tomorrow morning, before Carl comes back, I mean, if you'd like to.
Where are you going?	I'm going to pick up some friends of Carl's. Are you all right?	I have to talk to you.
No, I want to talk to you now. I have to explain something about# 	No, you don't have to, it isn't necessary# 	Yes, it is!
No, I can't# 	Will you let me talk to you, please?	I can't do that. I haven't been being fair to Carl. I have to tell you that.
Robert, do you mind?	What?	Nothing. Will you excuse us for a while?
Do you have a name?	Victor.	What?
Yo.	Hi.	Remember me, from the pool?
So you got a girl?	Of course.	So what's her name?

Hey you're really nuts.	They didn't do anything.	What? What are you talking about?
So what do you figure?	No idea.	No idea at all?

Has he?	Boy, what the hell's the matter with you?	Then he has.
I'm calling the police. Then I'm leaving. You wait here for them.	Where are you going?	Away. I think it might take you a while to get your life back together. You don't need me around.  Don't go back in there.
We can't talk about it here.	Why not?	Because we can't.
Yo!	Can I steal you for a minute?	Only if you promise not to return me.
Thanks.	You doing a story on this guy?	Maybe.
Hi.	Hi.	I was hoping you'd say that.
I really should change.	No, I think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today.	I mean put clothes on.
Thanks for the great time.	What is this?	Long story.
So?	So, your husband hired me to kill him. That's the truth.	What are you talking about?
And they're leaving the country tomorrow night.	Bastard.	I don't have all the pieces yet, but I'm close. I'll know tomorrow.
Don't worry, I can take it.	You shouldn't be here.	I want to hear this.
Where is she?	Moved out.	She moved out?
I spoke to her last week. She didn't say anything.	She moved out.	So you're saying she moved out.
But I ain't got you# 	But I ain't got you# 	No, I ain't got you# 
I tried to help you# !	And hey, I appreciate it# 	Where's my father?  Have you even looked?
So, did you find my dad?	Well, I got some good news and some bad news.	Yeah, go on# 
Did I say you could move that hand $  I'm not gonna get stuck am I?	No - no.	Cause if I do.
Who knows?	Where do you want it?	This side.
Did you pick up the car?	It is waiting for you in the garage.	Did they follow you?
All right, get up on that bar and dance.	What?	Get up on the bar and show me how you work.  If I like it you don't have to go in.
It looks open on the other side.	Don't know what's behind it.	One way to find out.
I'm off.	Wish you weren't.	Do you know how much I love you?
I'll be upstairs# if you want to play.	I'm serious.	So am I.
I'm scared.	Don't be scared.  This time I'm right behind you if you fall.	Daddy, Daddy, I can't.
You ready?	Wait# 	I'm right here behind you# 
Sorry 'bout that.	What'd you just say?	Oh, that was my kid.
You call your son Little Chief?	Uh huh# 	What'd you say your name was?

What are you talking about?	I lost you.	What?
Dad# ?	Chief?!  Is that you?	Yeah, it's me.
Dad, I gotta tell you this# cause you should know.  Cause I still remember.	What, Johnny?  What is it?	What it was like when you died in the fire# 
John, you still there?	I'm right here, Dad.	You all right?
I need you to believe in me.  To believe that we can do this.	John, he's got my driver's license.	What?
Wait.  Something's wrong.  I don't# 	What's wrong?	I don't remember.  Why don't I remember?
My father didn't die in a fire?	Huh?	My father didn't die in a fire?
She makes ten.	Ten?  No.  I remember this case.  Three. He killed three women.	What're you talking'?  You know better than anybody, John.  You've read this file a thousand times.
You used to be on the job?	Yeah, long time ago.  I know you?	I look familiar?
You haven't changed a bit.  Always so sure of yourself.  Even when we were kids, when you wanted something, nothing could stop you.	Is that so bad?	I don't know.
This door was open just a minute ago, wasn't it?	What?	Nothing.
Look what I found.  Remember these?	Did you stay here last night?	No.  I got here just before you did.
What happened that night?	You promised you'd never ask me.	After you left me that night, I didn't see you or talk to you again for a year.  No one would tell me anything.  All I know is what the police told me.  We have nowhere to go unless you let me in.  What happened?
Faster!  Eat faster!	Why don't you help us?	Uh#  I guess I'm just not hungry.
Is#  is everything all right?	Everything's gonna be fine.	Excuse me, but I believe that's mine# 
Why do you do these stupid things?!	I have to.	You don't "have to."
There# Ya happy?	No.	Why?
# but there just may not be enough time.  If you still care about her, if you still want to try to make things better between you two# we should talk.	So let's talk.	No.  Not here.  Come by my house tonight at eleven.  Don't be late.
I know who you are.	I need to talk to you.	I'm kind of busy right now# 
No, I $ 	Twenty.	Look $ 
What do you want?	You know what I want.  You know why I need you.	You need to leave.
Everything going okay?	It's going.	Legs giving you trouble?
Everything'll work out.  Trust me on that.	Okay.	Good night, beautiful.
Maybe you should be moving on.	Maybe you should mind your own business.	Get up!
Why did you want her body?	For a good reason.	Tell me.
Wanna know how I did that?	Yeah# 	Gotta go.  See you guys later.
Well?	I'm sorry.  I have to bring you to a cell.	Are you crazy?!
I'll be back later.  You just be cool, okay.	Okay.	Don't do anything stupid.
How many times do you want to hear this?	Until I hear the truth.	I've told you the truth.
All right, all right $  I'm a major ass.	And you'll never do it again.	And I'll never do it again. Forgive me?
She never should've set foot on this ship. This is your fault!	This is Jason's fault!	Not another word, do you hear me??
I got you a present.	But I didn't get you one# 	Forget it. It's a dumb little thing anyway.
I used to carry a gun when I drove a cab.	Where is it?	I gave it away. I thought, I'm a writer now.
This could be it.	This could be it.	Let's work on it.
This could be it.	This could be it.	This could be it.
I never see you anymore. Where are you all day?	I go to college. I thought you knew.	Do you want to get some coffee?
And you blame me. It's because we never talk. Let's talk.	I have a class. I'm late.	Can we talk later? Will you be at the party?
Who is it?	I'm at the door.	Go way. I'll call a cop.
Then they lost?	Why does it matter?	If they lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow. It's all over.
Do you think he can do it?	I don't know.	He's a very sweet man.
You've come to me. I wanted to believe you would one day.	I haven't come to you.	But you're here. So you must have come to me.
You really need that much?	More than that.  You'll get used to it.	God, what wouldn't you do to leave the planet?
Where are we going?	I'm sorry.  I've got plans.	Again?
Hello?	How would you like to be yourself for the day?	I was never very good at it, remember?
Why have you done this?	In case you get back before I do.	Where are you going?
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean anything.	We were just looking.	I know about you.
You didn't know?	Yes# yes# 	You're angry$ 
What about the car?	Let's walk.	Who are they?
The doctor will give you something.	I'm not doing it.	Honey, you've made one mistake$ 
Hello, Doc.	Hi.	You okay?
Feel good?	Yeah.	Where do you want to go?
It doesn't look like that.	What do you mean? You've never been there.	I've been there every day for the last four years.
You go out much?	After four years and now the question comes up.	Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.
I guess I'm kind of# 	It's all right.	It's just been a while.
I'll be okay.	Listen, I'm just as nervous as you are.	Really?
I was going to fix you breakfast.	You were asleep.	I bought you a lot of new things.
Promise you won't laugh.	If it's funny I'm going to laugh.	I feel like the night before the first day of school.
Why didn't you tell me?	There wasn't any way to explain it.	Yeah.
How long ago.	Fifteen minutes.	Sure?
When we had trouble before it was different.	You don't like the way things are, I don't like the way things	What do you want to do?
You've got it all figured.	No#  there's a couple of things I'm still working on.	Like what?
That would be the first time.	When are you going to learn?	I did I killed a man.
I want to say something.	I don't want to hear it.	Listen to me. It's hard enough.
Look, what you said yesterday#  I guess that was right. It isn't worth anything if we don't make it together.	I don't think we can any more#  If we ever get out of here, maybe I should take off# 	We got this far.
Sounds good.	You want to try with me?	Things can't get much worse can they?
Okay.	You and me.	Can we make it?
Come on, come on.	Who was it?	Just get your clothes on# 
You okay?	Where do we go from here?	I don't know, airport I guess.
Are we going to make it?	Hell, I don't know#  but we sure gave it a run.	Whatever happens#  we're going all the way.
Hope you get to where you're going.	Thanks. Hope you do too.	By the way, you're getting a hell of a car there, mister.
Just in case someone gets a shot off.	I worked ten years without one, I don't need one now.	Suit yourself.
Listen#  how much money did you make this year?	What's it to you?	Come on. How much?
I don't think you have to worry much about Harold. He won't do anything.	That right?	You can trust him# 
What do you want?	What happened to this car?	What's it got to do with you?
You know what the bloody time is!  It's two o'clock in the bloody morning!	I know.	Well?
I made a mistake.	What?	I made a mistake.
Jack?	Good evening.	I'd like a word with you, Jack.
Train goes at four minutes past twelve. You've just got time.	That's very kind of somebody. Who do I have to thank?  What happens if I miss the train?	I've been asked to make sure you don't.
Who paid you to see me off?	I can't Jack. How can I?	Yes you can.
Really.	I must go. I'm in a hurry.	I want to talk to you later.
Yes. I met him last year.	Go on.	Oh yes. When he came up on business.

Are you alright?	Yes.	Did you like your party?
I don't have a lot to say, Michael.	We have time.	I was kept pretty much in the dark. I didn't know all that much.
If you told Michael what I've told you today, I'm a dead man.	When is it finally over?  I want it to be over before my baby is born.	I don't know.  I hope soon; but it's not over yet, and that's why you and the kids have to come back to me.
You're going to talk to him now.	Yes.	Will you tell him?
Did the boy get something from me for Christmas?	I took care of it.	What was it, so I'll know.
How's the baby?	Sleeping inside me.	Does it feel like a boy?
It's Michael.  How are you, Mom?	I'm alright.  Will you stay home for awhile?	There are still things I have to do.
I know.	When do we talk?	After dinner.
So you don't want to fuck.  That's what you're telling me?	Is that all this conversation means to you?  Am I going to put out or not?	Damn straight.  I'm sick of playing games.
It's your job, lady, not mine.  I'm here so he can draw my picture.	I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.	What're you talking about?
I didn't do it.  This wasn't me.	Oh, Mr. Jimmy.	He wanted me to kill him, but I didn't.  He did it himself.
Saw your movie the other night. Watched it with some friends.	Did you now?	I liked it.  We all did.
I suppose you'd like the top down.	If that's okay?	Nothing would please me more.
Who's that?	David.  The friend I thought was in New York.	No.  The girl.
No.  It won't do.	What won't do?	You are much too human.
All right.  Let's take it off now.	What was that?	It's too tight.
Please.  You shouldn't stand on my account.	Perfectly all right.  But if you'd like to sit $ 	I'm fine, Jimmy.  I can only stay a few minutes.
Can that count as one question?	Of course.	I can't believe I'm doing this.
I think about that night a lot# 	Me, too. Every time I walk# 	How they were just there #  Waiting on us #  The fix was definitely in # 
I'm not interested $ 	I knew you'd say that.	I'm just here about my brother.
Get out of here, Ray $ 	One more night $ 	Get out $ 
I know you $ 	You know my back -	You want to come along quiet?
I'm on the move -	Your girl works in there # 	Not my girl anymore
It just ain't happening $ 	You'll get the hang of it, kid. You just need to remember one thing -	What's that?
You look good# 	You, too, Ma# 	What are you doing back?
Have you seen him?	No.	oh.
Why didn't you tell me?	I couldn't. I didn't want you to worry. I thought held sort himself out. I hardly see him. He comes and goes. He's in trouble, isn't he?	He's in some trouble # 
You goin' home?	Yeah#  You want a ride# 	Sure -
You okay $  ?	Totally. I'm fine. You want a beer, man $  ?	Sure $ 
So what are you gonna do?	About what?	"About what?"
Come here $ 	What?	Come here -
What are we gonna do $  ?	Hospital.	We can't do that, dude $ 
I go with you $ 	That what you want?	That's what I want # 
So, you seeing anybody?	No. I had a girl. She was great. The problem is: great girls come along once every ten years. So I gotta wait another three years before I can even bother to look# 	She was so great, why'd you leave her?
Go inside. I'll be right there.	What are you gonna do?	Get inside!
For Christmas. Your share.  It's just a taste.	Jimmy.	We did it.  We did it.
Give'm a drink.	I gotta talk to you.	Have a drink first.
You know what to do?	Yeah, yeah.	Now this is important. Make sure you leave the house when you make the call. You understand? Do you hear me? It's important.  Call from an outside phone. I mean it.
Come on, relax. He's drunk.  He's been locked up for six years.	I don't give a shit. That guy's got no right.	Tommy. He. doesn't mean anything. Forget about it.
Tommy, don't fuck around. Put the gun away. Tommy!	No, no. It's okay.	Tommy, come on. Put the gun away.
I don't need this#  You said tonight and now it's not tonight# 	It's okay. I'll make it up.  I promise. Just hurry it up a little. Okay?	Okay?
He didn't call?	He's with his friends.	What kind of person doesn't call?
Keep fuckin' with me. Watch what happens.	All right, then.	Watch what happens.
How's the woman?	Gone.	What?
What class?	Ah, history I think.	Oh# 
Hi.	How you doin'?	Good.
I guess so.	What? No. This is my mother's house. I don't live with my mother. I just stop by, help out. I'm good like that.	Is this a bad time?
What class did you say that was?	History.	How'd you like that course?
Okay, you're in your bed, Will. Now how old are you?	Seven.	And what do you see?
Oh, I'm sorry.	What're you doing?	I'm sorry.
Thank you.	I just want you to know# It's been a pleasure.	Bullshit.
Not Rick? You didn't send him to Rick?	Just meet with the boy once a week.	Can we do it at my office?
You're here quite a bit, then.	I live right around the corner.	You moved?
Seems like it's going well.	I think so.	Well, have you talked to him at all about his future?
So I hear you're taking some time.	Yeah. Summer vacation. Thought I'd travel some. Maybe write a little bit.	Where're you going?
Yeah, I read those.	What did you think?	I'm not here for a fuckin' book report. They're your books, why don't you read 'em?
Maybe you should be a patient and sit down.	Maybe you married the wrong woman.	Watch your mouth.
Yeah? You got a lady now?	Yeah, I went on a date last week.	How'd it go?
They're all dead.	Not to me, they're not.	But you can't give back to them, Will.
Oh, I know.	It's not your fault.	I know.
Oh, you will?	No# I was hoping to get a kiss.	Then why don't we just get it out of the way.
Where have you been?	I'm sorry, I been real busy.	You were busy? You know, I really was waiting for you to call me.
How's it goin'?	Fine.	Want me to take a look?
Yes I do. Did you ever think that maybe I could help you? That maybe that's the point, that we're a team?	What, you want to come in here and save me? Is that what you want to do? Do I have a sign that says "save me" on my back?	I don't want to "save" you. I just want to be with you. I love you. I love you!
They're all gone$ or dead.	They never wrote you nothing?	No. They wasn't people to write.
Where you think you're going?	Thought I'd take a walk. Any law against it?	Well, you just turn around and walk the other way.
Anybody ask anything?	No'm.	Stand by the door.
Morning.	Morning.	You people looking for work?
You do not.	Yes I do.	You don't# 
We had pictures put on, that way everybody knows who everybody was!	Wonderful.	So, what are you doing now?
I figured I could pick you up tomorrow around seven o'clock.	Let me get this straight, are you asking me out?	Yes.
Are you there?	Yes.	Pick me up at my father's house at around seven. And don't be late this time.
He was trying to kill you, right!	Yes.	Not the other way around# ?
How do you know?	I just know.	Say more.
You look like you're far away. Far away and thinking about other things. I'm right about that, aren't I?	No.	Well, let's just say that sometimes I'm right. Sometimes you are.
I told them to kill you and they didn't.	Hard to get good help these days.	But since we're both here, I think it's time to take a fresh look at our relationship.
No deal.	Fine. But we're not going to let you do your job. Because we're gonna do it. And then, after we do your job, we're gonna do another little job# 	Is that right?
I wish he'd do his job already so we could do our job.	We can't do our job unless he does his job.	Why don't we just do his job then, so we can do our job, and get the fuck out of here.
He's falling for her. Look at him.	He using her.	You're wrong. Look at his face.
Looks like someone keeps trying to do our job for us.	If he does our job, he's our job.	I get it.
They're not happy, sir.	I'm not happy.	They say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep.
It's good to see you. I'm sure you're curious about what I've been doing.	I spoke to your father the other day.	I imagine that'd be rather difficult.
Marty! It's me. Paul.	Paul?	You're leaving me hanging here# 
It didn't work out.	That's too bad.	I have to get my head back into my work.
Why not?	So what are you doing with your life now, son?	I'm a professional killer.
Shit.	Need a lift?	I can handle it!
How long did you live here with your wife?	Five years. My son was born here.	Son?
Show me again.	Annie!	One more time.
Then what have we been doing? I mean what was the point?	The point was to love each other.	Why?
Oh, honey#  What happened?	Doesn't matter. I#  I don't want to come back, that's all.	Oh. Well, what are you going to do? You have to go to school, honey. I mean, what $ 
No, I don't mean you have to. It's just that we may not have enough $ 	$  enough time tomorrow. I know.	Look, if you want to take it in the morning, that's fine.
You should call your dad before it gets too late.	I already did.  This morning. When you went running.	Oh. You didn't tell me.
Would you like to see that?	I don't care.	I don't care.
How long is this going to go on?	What?	You know what I mean?  Is this it now? Is this the way we're going to be from now on?
Did you ask him to come visit?	You already did.	Did he mention it?
Honey, come on. Would you like to stay in town for dinner? Maybe see what movie's playing tonight?	Why? There's no food in the house?	No. I just thought#  forget it.
Does anybody out there want something to drink?	I'll take care of it.	Thanks, honey.
Who's going to want me now?	What?#  Oh baby# 	Who's ever going to want me? Nobody will.
Who is it?	Uh, nothing. I'm going to pick it up in the other room $  would you hang this up for me?	Sure.
Oh, I miss you. You look beautiful.	So do you.	How's everything?
It's me.	Hi.	Hi.
So, what, uh, what train are you taking?	I should be in by two.	Okay. You want me to pick you up?
I'm sorry about last night. I shouldn't have brought it up over the phone.	That's okay. We have to talk about it and we're not always in the same place #  so#  I just have to get used to it.  What do you want to do about dinner?	I don't know. We'll figure it out.
That bag's almost empty.	No, it's got a little left. They'll be in to change it.	Robert, you leave it up these people# !
Did you get a hold of that horse guy?	Yeah.	What did he say?
What if she doesn't want to go?	She will if you think she should.	And you think it's best if I don't come.
I miss you, Annie.	I know. We miss you too.	Good night.
You were right about coming here. I'm sorry for not thinking# 	No, it's okay. Believe me, there were plenty of times I didn't know what the hell was right.	How are you feeling about work?
I have so much to tell you.	You want to take a walk with me?	Where to?
What?	Annie, I'm not good at this kind of talk $  goes round and round a thing but never comes to it $  so let's just say what it is. When you first came here, I didn't like you and I was worried. Tom means a lot to me and this family. Don't go looking here for whatever you looking for. Don't make that man go through something it took him a long time to see his way clear out of the first time.	I don't think anybody can make Tom do anything he didn't want.
Would you let me ride your horse?	Have you talked to Tom about it?	Of course I have.
Can you drive?	Drive? I'm not old enough yet.	It's never too soon to start.
Grace, I need you to come with me.	No, you're only going to hurt him some more.	He's not hurt. He's okay. Look at him.
IT WAS MY TURN!	YA JUST HAD A TURN. IT WAS NOT.	WAS SO!
I can't believe it's the same horse.	We still have a way to go.	How much longer do you think?
What are you looking at, young man?	How long were you married?	Long enough.
Well, that'll happen.	Where did you learn all this stuff?	What stuff is that?
Here's your class.	My#  class. You mean I'm not in your class?	No, you're not in my class.
What the hell are you doing?	It's cool, I'm just looking.	It's too much machine for you.
Thank you.	Okay. I'll copy it.	Okay, thank you.
Hello?	We caught 'em.	Good.
We need to talk.	Okay sure. What about?	Its about tonight.
Are you two okay?	We've been better.	What's going on?
Honey, I don't think their home.	How do you know their not?	Because the lights are all out.
Sure it does.	I know you miss your parents, its hasn't been that long.	It's been eleven months.
What are you doing out here alone?	Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.	Oh no you can't. I've just been there. That's the first place he'll look for you. Where's the school house? Where is the school house?
Hell of a night.	Its not over yet.	Where are you going?
Something?	He's been here.	How do you know?
Why didn't you wait for me?	We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up.	That's not true. Here I am.
Hello?	Why did you hang up on me?	Annie, was that you?
I'm scared.	Then why are you sitting here with half the lights off?	I don't know.
I gotta go.	Will you call me tomorrow?	Yeah, sure.
I'd like to talk to you, if I could.	May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here# 	It's important.
Jesus!	You all right?	Sure# 
Not any more.	Why are they under there?	Mom doesn't like me to have them.
Are you sure?	Yes.	How?
Oh, good# 	Come in, come in.	# because there are no interesting single men at this party!
It's French, though.  It really is.	Yeah.	It feels like you're in France.
We got that idea on that trip to Paris.	Right.	Hmm?
Yeah.	Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh?	Fast.
I thought you weren't coming.	I almost didn't.	Lee#  uh# 
You've been very cold to me tonight.	No.	Is something wrong?
Oh, let's not$ I, I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.	Are you angry with me?	No!
But you, God, you knew that was going to happen sooner or later.  I can't live like this!	Who is it?	What's the difference?!  It's just somebody I met!
Mickey, come on, we got a show to do!	I can't keep my mind on the show.	But there's nothing wrong with you.
Yeah.  What?	Can I tell you something?  Can I tell you a secret?	Yes, please.
Oh, great.	You look so beautiful.	Come on.
Can we, can we go?	No!	My$ uh# 
I'd never do that.	# in a really horrible way.	Oh, well, that was a long time ago.
So how are you?	I'm okay.	You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?
You're okay, though, huh?	I'm$  Yes.  Yes, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  How are you?	Oh, I'm fine.
So, so you want to go out to dinner again?  I mean, is that, is that#  Have, you have any interest in that, or# 	Sure.  Sure, uh, yes.	Do you?  I mean, are you, are you, are you, are you free this evening?
Now don't get nervous.  It's just your husband.	Hi.	Hi.  How you doin'?
Dad# 	Oh# 	Dad!
I can't think.	# you don't have to think.	We have to talk about money# 
What, What, I can't hear you# 	Are you alright# ?	I almost shot the baby# 
Hold up a minute# 	You spend the afternoon in Bed?	First things first.
My husband brought it to me from America.	A wonderful country# 	You know it?
And?  Then?	I wonder no longer.  You were out of the country.	How could you know?
Can you walk?  Are your legs working# ?	Perhaps#  shall we see# ?	I'm going to cut you loose.  With all due respect, Doctor, if you fuck with me, I'll shoot you dead, do you understand# ?  Do right and you'll live through this.
You look lovely.	Thank you.  No, I know you'd prefer "I'm glad you find me so# "	I'd prefer you to say what you feel.
# I'm sorry# .?	# we were speaking of my father# 	Indeed we were.
The girl could use some help.	You're free# 	# which of us is free# ?
What was it.  What was it, honey?	# something about my father# ?	# what?
# my love# 	# they asked us to dinner.  How can we accept if we cannot return the# 	I am on the track of# 
Hello# .?	# what did you want? 	I know where he is.
Fuck off.	I should leave. You probably need your rest.	Probably.
Ah, our last night at camp# I always knew it would be something special.	What do you want me to say?	Something more interesting than that# How could you?  How could$ !
Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I smoke these damn things?	Because you're an idiot.	Oh yeah, that's it.
Did you miss him completely?	Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth it just to see the look on# .	Don't move! I'll get him back!
What?	It's so beautiful!	What???
I'm coming with you.	Yes # 	I know what to do about mother.
Must be nice.	What?	Getting paid for doing shit.
And besides, I thought, to hell with it#  it's okay if you only married me for my money.	Really, why's that?	I only married you for your body.
Hey buddy!	#  but I'm starting to think I was#  I was going to# 	Hey buddy!
You okay?	I'm, uh, not sure#  Feeling kind of weird actually.	Really?
You should give it to someone with only one leg.	One leg!  Like the Red Cross or something?	I know a guy who only has one leg.
I#  no#  I don't have the right#  I# 	No, I don't have the right.  You're a news story!	Uh, right.  A#  news story.
My father didn't have his shoes on when he#  when he came here.	You were in bed.  Weren't you?	I#  I saw him out the window.
I was driving by $  I saw all the cars.  Are you all right?	Yeah, I'm okay $  it's been a long night.	What happened?
I hear what you're saying, but I know what you're thinking.	What?	You're thinking exactly what I thought when I first saw this house,
Did you hear that?	What?	Did you hear what he said?
How was lunch?	Huh?	How was your lunch with Charlie?
Do you remember who gave us this?	No.	There's no card or anything.
Honey?  How did it go?  You didn't call me.	He wasn't there.	What?
Do you see a man?	No.	No man!  Go to your room.
Is it a king or a queen?	It's a double.	Even better.
I'd like that.	Would you?	Uh huh.
What the hell.  What is this?  A joke?	No joke, Lieutenant.	Where's the guy we saw in the beginning $  what's his name# ?
When did you get back?	A few days ago.	That's what I figured.  Well, I have a little home coming present for you.
Where were you last night around nine?	I already told you.  I took a walk.	Tell me again.  Where'd you go?
She was a good woman.	You didn't bring me here to talk about her.	No.
I brought you here to talk about him. Do you know him?	No.	You sure?
Must you do that?	What?	Sing.
Life.  You've stopped living it.  You look, but you do not see.  You listen but, you do not hear.	I hear you.	What else?  What else do you hear right now?
The river.	That's all?	Yes.
I'm leaving.	Leaving what?	England.  There is nothing for me here anymore.
What are we doing here?	Living.  Remember?	You may be living $  but this suit is killing me.
I cannot stay.	Why not?	I'm leaving in the morning.
Good evening.	You're twenty minutes late.	Sorry.
Would you like to see it?	I've seen it.	On the back it has$ 
Where will you go now?	It will end tonight.	Must you fight him?
What now?	Now I can start to live.  To feel. To grow old and live each day without the promise of another.	Sounds very $  normal.
We found him this morning.	What's that next to him?	His head.  Someone cut it off.
Do you?  Then why don't you go out? Meet someone.  Make a life for yourself instead of hiding away in the past?	I like my work.	I'm having some people over tonight for dinner $  I'd like you come.
What are you doing?	I shouldn't have come back here.  It was a mistake.	Is it a mistake for someone to go to the ones who love them when they're in trouble?
Put our people on the scene.  Smith might talk just to cut a break for his kids.	He knows better than that.	Bullshit$ a man will do anything to save his family.  Who's running the show up there?
We're fucked.	We're fucked until we think of a way out; then we're rich.	There is no way out.
We're cool.	Let me speak to Mr. Smith.  I want to hear it from him.	Fuck you.  I'm running this shit.  You talk to me.
You've been in there a long time. What're you waiting for?	Would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life?	I'd be trying to get the best deal that I could.
My father needs a doctor.  Please.	Hey, I've got a situation here, in case you haven't noticed.	All you're doing is watching yourself on TV.  Look at him.
What about my father?	Aw, Jesus, not more of this.	Look at him!  I think he's dying!
You get the other one when I have my girls.  Not talk to them; have them.	Where is it?	Close.
I need to work out some stuff.	You're hiding, Jeffrey.  You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me.	I still see that boy's eyes.
We can't carry him.	You go, Thomas.  You get out, and I'll stay with Daddy.	I'm not gonna leave you!
Want one?	I don't drink beer.	Mommy won't know.  You can do anything you want right now.  Mommy won't know.
I'm not going to wake him.  I don't even know that I can.	Just one question.  Please.	He.  Can't.  Answer.
In a few minutes the white phone is going to ring.  So let's get our shit straight before that happens.	You used to be a cop.  All of you used to be cops.  I can tell by the way you move.	Don't worry about what we used to be.
Is my daddy okay?	The doctors are taking care of him right now.  Thomas #  are you safe?  Can you talk?	I think so.
I guess we each have something the other wants.	I guess we do.	My people are good to go.  You know who I mean?
Where are they going?	They can go where they want. They are in charge now.	What do you mean, General?
Time is money, George. We need extra beer today.	Business is good at the hotel?	Very good.
Get out of this room and get back to work.	I don't have to listen to you anymore.	I am in charge now. Get back to work or I'll fire you.
Give her what she wants, room, food, anything. Charge it all. Don't you put her out, Paul.	I would never do that.	I know that, Paul. I'm sorry.
Who did you call?	Call, sir?	Don't lie to me. What's your name?
Excuse me.	What?	Our cards, please.
I'm afraid you will have to move room.	Move? Where to?	I'm going to put you on the third floor.
Them. They almost got us all killed. I have done enough for them! We cannot look after them anymore.	What are you going to do? You cannot drive them out onto the road. They can stay with me.	What!
Any luck?	No answer. Please send someone to get them, please.	I'll try.
Paul, are you there?	Yes, thank you Mr. President.	Paul, if you have one call in all the world to stop this, who would you call?
Thanks.	Most fun I've had all day.	You need to get out more.
I was upstairs with Eddie $ 	$  that's the fact, bud $ 	$  where the hell were you?
Where did it go?	Run.	What $ 
You think this is fucking funny??	No, no, it's just $ 	$  well, here's a better one: you're fired.
Then tell me, please $  help me# !	Don't think so. Stay the fuck back.	Please! I need your help.
Are you all right?	A few years older, perhaps.	How's your arm?
Don't play games with me, little girl.	I didn't do anything, mommy.	Well then who did?!
She says she's lonely# 	Where is she?	She's here.
Can I have this room daddy?	Sure.  Did you see the others?	I want this one, daddy.
Mommy please help me!	Don't be afraid!	Daddy, please!!!
But do you agree with me?	Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.	Well what do you think it is?
How are we doing?	I think everything's ready.	Good.  I'll start bringing things in.
There's something in there.	What?	There's something through that wall!
Hello?	You wanted a story.  You got it.  Turn on the TV now.  And then get your ass down here #   # 	Doc?  #   Doc #  Hello?
Yeah.  Sure.  You mean #  tonight?	Of course tonight.  Is that a problem? Like, if you've got a guy there or something # 	No.  No.  It's fine.  Come now.  I was having bad dreams anyway.
What?	Your dream.  You said you were having a bad dream.	Oh yeah # 
Great.  Thanks.  You gonna have one?	I'm trying to quit.	Oh, go on.  Have one.  Fuck it.  You think you're going to live forever?
Jesus.  Are you sure this is the street?	Yeah.  Happening, isn't it?	What on earth were you doing down here?
For somebody else, alright?  Not for me. I don't do that shit anymore.	Then you shouldn't even be around it. You know, it's # 	Here!  Here!  Pull over!
Yes really.	Wow.  Thank you.	No.  Thank you.
But you gave me a rose # 	And tomorrow I'll give one to somebody else.  Get dressed.  Get out.	You shit.  Who do you think you are?
Count of three?	Why not just go now?	Okay.
Don't be stupid# they# 	Bastard!  If you were a true American.	Just shut up and hit me!
I'm, uh, going to bed.	So early?	Rough day. Good night.
Don't start.	You think I $ 	I have no idea.
This just isn't the best moment for this.	I know, I know. I had no idea $ 	That this was going to be a key party?
Do you think? Maybe we should call someone $ 	The phone's out.	Yeah. Well, we can just $ 
Hi dad.	Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?	I'm fine dad.
I'm picking up Paul at the station - want to come?	Nah.	What you been up to?
We don't have to always go to your club, dad.	And why are you still calling me dad? You're forty years old already, and $ 	$  Well what am I supposed to call you?
Now don't make me feel as if I'm being too forward, OK? If you don't $ 	What the hey. Let's go for a drive.	Okay. Shall we clean up around here first? Do you think it's all right$ 
You okay?	Yeah. You?	Yes. Well, I guess we can walk from here.
Oh.	It's really quite all right.	Of course.
No more man. I'm about to drop as it is.	See ya.	Where you going?
How can you do that man?	Do what?	Sleep all day. I mean, look, it's already getting dark outside, and you're just getting up.
Jesus, Jim!	Sorry honey. Hell, we've got to trade this thing in for a normal bed.	Just be careful.
Hey.  I'll take this stuff.	You going to tell dad?	Would it matter?  And what's that?
You're parents at that party?	Yeah. Yours?	You get in trouble?
It feels warm.	One more shot?	Okay.
I love you.	That's nice. Are you drunk?	I don't know. How do I know?
Will, you can't blame yourself.	I had him!	It's only gonna make you crazy.
Oh, I shouldn't have# 	It's okay.  Happened a long time ago.  He was killed in a fire.  In New Mexico.	That must have been awful for you.
I don't know what you're fucking talking about.	Friday night, at the party - what'd you fight about?	Stuff.
I don't know.	You don't know.	She didn't tell me.
I don't know.	You don't know.	She wouldn't tell me!
It was like some big fucking secret!	What was?	She kept saying she was gonna get out of here.  Leave us all behind.  That he was going to take her!
I'm sorry?	I said you're going to get a phone call.	Oh?
I thought maybe we could talk some more.	There's nothing more to talk about.	But we work so well together# 
I told you that was an accident!	Then so was mine# 	Don't you pull that shit with me.
Yes.  Like that.	This an accident, Walter?	If you want it to be# 
The one who made you should have told you this. The one who left the old world for the new# 	He knew nothing. He just didn't care.	Knew? You mean he is# 
You didn't even warm them, did you?	No.	And yet you knew what I would o.
Which of you did it? Which of you made me the way I am?	What you are? You would be something other than you are?	And if I cut my hair again?
You made us what we are, didn't you?	Stop her Louis!	DID YOU DO IT TO ME????
They would have killed you -	Then my luck would have changed.	You want death? Is it death you want?
Let's call that a start.	I can't do it.	You've just done it -
You really want to be with them?	Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -	You asked for death. I didn't promise it -
Unless I make her one of us# 	NO!!!	THEN YOU KILL HER!!!!!
But why did you tell her?	How could I not? She had to know.	And did you lose her? Did she go?
You promise to care for her then?	Yes# 	And you know what you ask for?
I don't know, man. Maybe we should keep going, find a phone $ 	No.	The guy looks dead.
Say yes.	No.	No means yes.
No way.	Yes.	No.
Oh, god, it's you $ 	You're okay. Thank god.	Is he?
I got in early. I was excited#   Who was that guy?	Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.	Yeah.

This was not my idea.	What?	I said, this# Do you want a drink?
You guys lost?	Tell me this ain't the bar scene.	Wanna drink?
What's the matter, boy trouble?	Not anymore.	He leave you?
I felt he did not like me.	That should decide it or you $ 	I will let him go. He is dead to me as he is to all my mother's people. I turn my hand against him.
You what? To save me?	Well, I did, didn't I? You didn't go through with it, did you?	Go through with what?
What'd you say?	I said I wish I'd never been born.	Oh, you mustn't say things like that. You #   #  wait a minute. Wait a minute. That's an idea.  What do you think? Yeah, that'll do it. All right.  You've got your wish. You've never been born.

You tell me.  No?  I thought you'd maybe have a theory.	Oh, I've got plenty.	I'd like to hear them.
Any movie stars buried here?	Probably.	It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view.
What the fuck are you doing here?	Looking for you.  I tried the hotel.	Why'd you come here?
I can't let you in.	Yeah, I know.	You want more money, is that it?
Him too.	We've got to get you to a hospital.	Don't bother.
Where'd you learn that?	What?	That.
This is where we killed him.	You didn't try hard enough.	I can't#  I can't go any further# 
He did something with the ground.	Yes?	Can you do it?
Why's that?	He said he knew how to protect us. But he didn't know anything.  He made us think it was over and done with.	What is?
You could still help me do that.	Why would I want to?	Because you've got nothing else to live for.
You know I'll kill you when we're done.  I have to.	Yes.	But until then#  it's you and me#  the way it always was.
Wait#  you still feel something for that bitch?	No!	Liar!
Hello?	Bob, it's me.	Oh, hi, Elaine.

I guess she's busy.	That's ok.	When are you coming home?
Will you please stop smoking?	But I like to#  and I don't smoke that much.	Its bad for you.
You're glad somebody tried to kill me?	No, of course not, but I think now that this has happened, a lot of things can start to come out# 	Yeah, like# 
What're these?	I don't know.  What are they?	I found them in your file box.
What is it?	Something he said, just before# 	He spoke to you?
So# what did you think of the tape.	I think you gave me the wrong one.	What do you mean?
You okay?	When's your birthday?	What?
Plenty of time.	What are these?	I don't know.  Extra apartment keys. What's it matter?
What's up?	How're you doin' today?	It's another day.  I think I'm alright.
I hate it.	Fine, you don't like this one, which one would you rather wear?	Pants.
Taste this.	I can't eat before a game.	Child, take a bite.
So that's why we can't get along? Because I'd rather shoot a "dumb" jump shot?	You're the one always turning your nose up at me.	No I don't.
She needs to stop running around like a little boy.	She's alright.	How is she alright looking the way she does?
Which one for tomorrow?	The blue.	You sure?
You might want to put a jacket on him, it's getting cold.	He's fine.	Okay.
I'm an English major.  You like English?	Sort of.	Careful.
That was nice.	Uh-huh.	Your sister told me hands off, but I can't help myself# 
Damn, girl.	What?	I don't wanna see that.
Nah.	Why not?	You might be the only one with a job.
That too tight?	No.	Mom's going to hate it.
You ever been in love?	Too many times.	They ever love you back?
What's up?	Just wanted to say good game.	But?
What do I have to do?	I guess, you know, we play ball and we ride to school together.  And if you get mad at me, I gotta give you flowers.	I don't like flowers.
I think we gotta kiss now.	For how long?	Five seconds.
That's it, give it your best shot.	Would you watch the damn road?	I mean it, give it your best shot, cause I'm tired of you holding that over my head.
Hey.	Hey.	You having fun?
When'd you get this?	It was on my bed when I came in.  Can you just# ?	You sure?
Hey.	What's up?	I've been trying to find you all day.
Who was that?	Nobody.	Who's nobody?
Hey.	Hey, what's up.	You weren't at my game.
What?	I'm going through a lot of shit right now, more than you have time for.	How are you going to tell me what I have time for?  I mean, whatever I did# we can fix this.
When did you decide all this?	Few days ago.	So that's it, just forget about us?
Just something I'm trying.	No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.	Thanks.
It just isn't.	Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too.	You had a rough couple years, that's all.
I heard enough.	What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you since I was eleven and the shit won't go away.	We haven't talked since college and now you wait two weeks before my wedding to say something like this?
What will this prove?	You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to.	So?
Hey, girl.	Hey.	Your hair looks so cute like that.
Not great.	What's that, not great?	The doctor'll be back in a minute.
What?	We still have to go?	Yeah.
Where's your dad?	Said he'd be home later.	Later when?
You scared me.	Sorry.  You okay?	I'm fine.
Yeah?  So you up for a game later?	I don't wanna hurt your feelings.	You don't wanna hurt your back.
So what are you gonna do?	I want this thing to go to court, but my lawyer's telling me to settle.	Why?
What do you want?	Came by to check on you.	After five years.
Why don't they have the same last name? They don't have the same last name.	I know $  and I can't really explain that, but I have a feeling there's something, some situation between them, like they don't really know each other much or well, something like they don't talk much anymore $ 	Uh-huh.

He's in here.	Let's just wait one minute and stay here, okay?	Ok.
How long have you taken care of him?	For six months.  I'm the day nurse# 	Uh-huh.  What's going on?
I'm here.  I'm here now.  What do you want? Do you want anything?	I don't think, he can't# 	# just wait# Dad# you want something# can you say# 
You look great.	What the fuck is this, Jimmy?	# you know# 
Rose is on the phone and here's the cards for today $ 	Fifteen minutes ago, where were those cards?	I'm sorry.
I don't think I want that.	It'll take the pain away.	It's not really pain.
How do we do this, then?	We just do it# we do it and we figure it out and we do as we do, I guess# 	Do you love me, Rose?
That's it.	No one else that I know?	No.
# Jimmy# 	I really don't know.	But you can't say# .
You deserve to die alone for what you've done.	I don't know what I've done.	Yes you do.
Was it a call back?	No.  But I probably will get a call back.	If we beat the record, you might get a call back $ 
You don't want any water?	No# I just#  I'm so fucked up here Alan, I don't know# there's so much# so many things $ 	Are you on drugs right now?
What's the problem, what's the problem here?	I'm fine. nothing.	Why didn't you answer those questions?
I didn't I'm fine, I'm fine.	Stand up.	I said I'm fine.
# oh Jesus, what the fuck# ?	I'm fine. I'm fine, I just wanna keep playing $ 	Why did you do this?
What is it, mother?	I wish to discuss your brother.	He is dead!  By God's choice!  There is nothing to discuss.
What had you to do with this, Mother?	He is your brother!	He is nothing now.
What is that?	A body.	I see that is a body!  But where did you get it?
Now.  You were saying?	But $  what is he doing?	About to hang himself, I should think.
Once you are through, don't stop until you reach the river.	They will know you helped us, if we go this way.	That doesn't matter now.
You look so sad.  Is it something I have done?	It is something I have done $  or did not do.	What is that?
I was just having a little fun -	And what did he do to the girl?	Nothing!  He didn't do nothing!
Captain there's someone here to see you - he's waiting in your office.	Who is it?	I don't know - but he's from the FBI.
So where are you from?	Up north.	Where up north?
Why did you set me up?	I didn't.  I figured you leave it well enough alone.	Well you figured wrong!  And now I'm public enemy number one.  You have an answer for that?
I had it all on tape# 	What did you do then?	I didn't know what to do - but I knew I had something somebody would want.  That's where I met him - told him what I had.  The FBI set me up with a new place# but the cops found me somehow.  So I ran# and met you.
And?# 	I killed them.	Oh, shit, shit, shit - I don't know about all this! You sure?!
Oh man# what happened?	I don't know.  But I'm in trouble. I'm all over the papers. I have to figure out what's going on.	Alright# alright# you've saved my ass enough times.  What do you want to do?
Where are you going?	Well I've kind of had my fill of the place, you know what I mean?	You must be going somewhere.
Long gone, huh?	I asked him not to tell me where he was going.  I told him I don't want any part of it.	Oh yeah?  You're a smart man?# 
Whatever I say, you'll take him away, won't you?	I have to.	You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?
If you can't look anymore, I understand# 	As long as they're dead# 	These are all dead, Will.
Who is it?	It's me.	Who?
Do you know something about that?	Why do you think I called?	I get a lot of calls. Most of them are from people who say they know things.
To yourself# 	I call him a monster.	I understand he cut you pretty good# 
He stopped by to see me at the shop before he came out here.	What did he want?	He asked how you are.
What the hell can I do?	What you've already decided. You're not really asking.	If I were?
Did the girl die?	No.	She got all right?
No.	"No"?  "No" to which part??	No to the whole thing.  None of it sounds good.
Five.	Twenty!	Ten.
Hi# 	Hi#  am I late?	No, I'm sure we'll be fine.
Hi# 	Hi#  am I late?	No, I'm sure we'll be fine.
Go away.	It's me.	Oh, it's open.
I'm gonna quit.	What?!?	Each show is worse than the next.
Give me the book.	No!  Andy, don't do it $ 	They're asking for it.
I dunno about this#   What will my mother think?	She'll say, "Now my son is a man."	It's so dirty.
I saw Michael!	Where?	There!
Sure# 	What's your name?	Bob.
Weird.	What?	That's the third white van I've seen.
Do you?	I#  it doesn't matter what I believe.	You don't, do you?
Give me your phone.	They'll be able to track it.	We have no choice.
What the fuck do they want with me?!	I'm not sure, but if you don't want to find out, you better get out of there.	How?!
Get some rest.  You're going to need it.	For what?	Your training.
Did you go to her?	Yes.	What did she tell you?
Go!	We can't leave him!	We have to!
What are you doing?	I'm going in after him.	You can't!
What are you doing?	I'm coming with you.	No, you're not.
Ok, you guys get out, and wait here for me.	Why?	I gotta get the stuff.
Hey, come on# 	Take it easy.  I only asked because maybe I could, you know, let you have a little something.	Yeah, well thanks, but I got enough to hold me.  My mother can send me some.  I don't know.
Hey# you got nothing here.	I could have told you that.	We'll get some food from my aunt's. I'll get in through the fire escape. She's always got something.
No# I'll be ok for a week.	You seen Johnny Boy tonight?	Nope# 
Out!!!!	C'mon Johnny.	You getting out too?
Uncle, how are you feeling?	Fine.  Did you have a good time last night?	About that shooting last night# I was there and# 
Wasn't a book# was a short story.	What was it?	Nothing.
I'd like to eat something before I go back to work.	Ok, we'll go for lunch.	Do you have enough?
Please take it.	Well# 	I don't mind.
Sure# it's not that# I mean# 	It's all right.	Well, if things go the way I hope they'll go, this money business will take care of itself.  God willing.
Alright#  Hey, did you hear any more about what happened last night?	Did you?	No.
C'mon Charlie# one more day.  I'll call in sick for work.	No# we can come back in a couple of weeks.  Besides, if we're both gone for three days it wouldn't look right.	Ok.
You know why# with my parents.	Well you can't blame them in a way.	I can take care of myself.  You know that.
Don't count it# it's all there.	Count it.	Hey, c'mon - no bullshit - friends.
Just keep him quiet.	Friends of yours Michael.	Shut up.
What is this?	Annie made them.	Who's Annie?
Yeah, but $ 	But what?	What will I tell Annie?
Yes, sir?	Hello.  I'm Joe Black.  Nice to meet you.	Yes sir, Mr. Black, a pleasure.
Anything else, Mr. Black?  How about some water?	Why yes, thank you.	Hot or cold.
Oh, you come to see Doctor Lady?	Yes.	My Doctor Lady?
Yah.	You loved back?	I am.
What are you doing here?	I'm lost.	$  Can't seem to escape you today.
No, I'm not.	Girlfriend?	No.
Where are you going?	Nowhere?  I'm# here.	For how long?
We know so little about each other $ 	We know all that we need to know $ 	But there's so much to tell you $ 
Tell me you love me $  tell me you love me now $ 	I love you now, I'll love you always $ 	Hold me $ 
What a good idea.	Thank you.  Would you like the man's name?	No.
Good morning.	Good morning, Bill.	How are you?  How're you feeling?
And what?	And I won't tell anyone who you are.	Sounds fair enough.
Bill $ 	Yes?	You've got a deal.
Joe $ ?	Yes, Bill.	How about giving a guy a break?
$  I don't deserve this.  I'm still young, this is not my time $ 	That's what everybody says.	I'm not everybody.
What's it like?	What do you mean?	What's it like where I'm going?
And more.	Why didn't you stop me?	Well# I don't know.
Why did you go to the hospital?	I don't know.	You were just curious?
I'm sorry, Bill $ 	That's okay.	What's okay?
Yes, I saw you see me.	Well, you're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman.	I'll be the judge of that.
You are?	Yeah.	Good.  Tomorrow, after the party.
$  And I'm in love with your daughter.	Say again?	I'm in love with your daughter, and I'm taking her with me tonight.
Not exactly.	I guess you have your reasons.	Yes.
Yes.	Death!	That's me.
Where are you?  Are you there?	It's enough now.	Please.  Talk to me $ 
But he does give a shit.  Don't you, Bill?	Yeah, I give a shit.	See.  There.  What'd I tell you?
Eddie?	Yeah - Bill - How are you?  You okay?	Fine, fine.  Big doing up here.  Why are you still down here?
You know each other?	We've met.	What?!
But what?	I want you to know how much I love you.  That you've given a meaning to my life that I had no right to expect, and that no one can ever take from me.	Daddy $ 
Should I wear it?	No. Just leave the stuff lying around as if it were yours. Like you just took it off or something.	Whatever gets you off.
You don't know?	I think I may have. I'm not good on the phone.	You said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them. Don't you remember?
How long have I been here?	Couple days.	So you're holding my calls?
I know you said you didn't want any calls# 	That's right I did, didn't I?	Yeah, but there's a call for you from this guy. He's a cop.
What?	Who did this to you?	You did.
I like your car.	Thanks.	Where'd you get it?
Jimmy?	What the fuck are you doing here?	Do you remember me?
Why?	I don't want blood on them.	Wait! Did he tell you what I was bringing?
Yeah.	So you have information for me?	Is that what your little note says?
How do I know he did that to you?	I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.	So I just take your word?
His name was Jimmy.	What happened?	He went to meet somebody and didn't come back.
Me? Why would he be interested in me?	I told him about your car.	Why would you do that?
What's wrong?	Somebody's come. Already.	Who?
Neither do I.	Don't protect him.	I'm not.
Calm down.	That's easy for you to say! You can't get scared, you don't remember how, you fucking idiot!	Just take it easy, this isn't my fault.
My wife.	Sweet.	Dying.
Beer, please.	What do you want?	A BEER, please.
You're the memory guy?	How do you know about me?	My boyfriend told me about you.
How can you read that again?	It's good.	You've read it a hundred times.
She's gonna use you. To protect herself.	From who?	Guys who'll come after her. Guys who'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend. They'll want to make somebody pay. Maybe she'll try and make it you.
Happy now?	I won't be happy until you leave town.	Why?
I thought we had to meet the Man.	You do.	When?
How fast does that go?	It goes very fast.	Show me# ?
Would you find me# ?	Of course.	Where would I go?
No part of it wasn't real.	I know.  And now?	It still is.  I'm so in this, I don't know which way is up#  All I know is I won't let anything bad happen to you.  Just like I said.  And I know we can't ever see each other again.  And we never will.
You okay?	Yeah.	You sure?
Okay# see you soon.	# and thanks for the flowers.	What flowers?
I can tell, can't you?	Yeah, oh yeah.	What'll we do? Leave now or what? Your place or mine? Oh God, the second I looked at you I knew. Did you?
Let's see how you look. Fine. You look fine. Now I'm gonna have to have that other ten# 	Ten, ten $  I got a twenty $  take that# 	Oh hell, forget it.
What d'you want?	What?	What you got me up here for?
It's there!	What?	Listen!
You know where they are?	Sure.	How far?
Okay?	Yeah!	Jimmy?
What?	Cut his fucking throat.	Whose?
Never was anybody like you# 	You can't take anything seriously.	You're right.
His name?	Who?	The lawyer?
Peter# 	Yeah# ?	There's some weird shit here.
A mistake.	"Mistake"?  What's that supposed to# ?	It doesn't matter, all right?  It's dead.
Keep going. We'll tell you when to stop# 	Maybe they lied to you.	Even if they did#  that's all we have, isn't it?
# you don't even know what you're looking for.	You said that thing was big as your hand.  I don't think I'm going to miss# 	Why take the chance?  Just let me go down there with you# 
C'mon# 	Ah# 	Talk to me.
Must get lonely, living out here all by yourself.	I always say if you can't enjoy your own company, you're not fit company for anyone else.	You got a point there# 
But what?	Nothing.	No, what is it?
You want me to burn my book?	Yes.	You want me to burn my book?
What's the matter, Paul? You haven't written a word.	I can't write this anymore.	Don't be silly. Of course you can.
I hope you like it.	It looks wonderful. And so do you.	Oh# 
Paul, I know you've been out.	What?	You've been out of your room.
No, no, of course not. It's just that his daughter hasn't heard from him, and when he's got a book coming out, he usually keeps in touch. So when there was no word from him# 	You think he might be missing?	I hate that I made this call$ tell me I'm being silly.
Do you know me?	No.  Should I?	No.  You just looked as if you did.
Look, it's either you or the rent and I don't mind telling you it's not an easy choice.	What if I pay the rent?	Uh-huh.
Ask a question, you get an answer!..	Damn, you're beautiful.	That's because I'm on my back.
Before you are.	How can you possibly?  I've got to get right on the plane.  I'm leaving now.	You don't trust me.
How's it going?  Everything okay?	Just like old times.	Just like old times?
Are you okay?	I am now.  Get me out of here.  Just get me out of here.	It's going to be okay.
No.  Should I?	No.  You just looked as if you did.	No# 
Sorry I didn't let you know where I was.	Don't be.  Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.	Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry.
I don't think I can get her to do it.	You mean it'll be difficult.	Very.
Did we get it?	We got it.  On your feet.	I want to sleep.  Can I sleep here.
You were in the car!	I wasn't.  I heard that Jim was in trouble on the radio.  He said someone was# 	Shut up!  I saw you.  You were in the car.
They're dead.  Jim's dead.	Take off your coat.	What?
Who are you and what are you doing here?	I need one hundred thousand dollars.	Really?  And you thought if you simply showed up I might give it to you?
Have I been a good wife?	Yes.	I want you to stop seeing her.
Have you come from my brother?	Yes.	Why?
Why?	Why what?	I don't know.
She was right to leave me.	You think so?	Yes.
Son of a bitch!	Where are you taking me?	To the bed.
I can't believe what is happening.	Me neither.	I was dead.
What?	That light.	I don't know. I think it's the moon.
What? What have we done?	Take it easy.	This time I was trying to do everything right.
Hi.	Hi.	You look beautiful. Your hair# 
That was just so#  awful!	Awful?	Beautiful. Sad. She died!
This is your place.	That's right.	This is where we're going!
I got things to do.	Sure you do. You got all that wedding stuff.	Right.
Have Something.	I shouldn't.	Will you marry me?
What about the wedding?	My mother is dying. When she is dead, I'll come back and we'll be married.	How near is she to death?
Will you live here?	No.	Why not?
How's the mother?	She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth.	Did he tell her?
Hi.	Where you been?	I don't wanna talk about it.
What the hell happened to you?	Well. I don't really know where to start.	Your hair's different.
Hi.	Hey there  # YOU WITH THE STARS IN YOUR EYES# 	What's the matter with him?
What about the moon?	Did you see it?	No.
Moving in?	I came right from the airport.	Come on in.
So.	Where is she?	Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.
That's my house.	You mean the whole house?	Yes.
None shall pass.	What?	None shall pass.
I'll do you for that.	You'll what #  ?	Come Here.
Too late.	What?	There he is!
Oh, shut up.	It's always the same #  if I've said it once.	Charge!
Well?	#  Well, we did do the nose.	The nose?
Who's that then?	I dunno, Must be a king.	Why?
Who are you?	I'm #  your son # 	Not you.
Er #  if #  we #  er # 	Yes?	If we #  er #  
Oh, I remember #  can he #  er #  can he leave the room with us?	No # .  keep him in here #  and make sure he doesn't # 	Oh, yes!  we'll keep him in here, obviously.  But if he had to leave and we were with him.
Where are you going?	We're coming with you.	No, I want you to stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room until I get back.
Well, she's got a point.	We'll cover your escape!	Look - I'm fine!
So?	So, there are rules.  Things you do and things you don't do.	I was just telling the woman how I feel, for God's sake.
And she sent no word down?	They said you were drunk.  Why don't you tell her the truth?	She'll think it's her fault for keeping me.
What are those?	What?	Those, over there, there.
They're ready now.	I hope they didn't go to any trouble, John.	Ah, well# 
John?	Yes, ma'am?	I was told you were in a fight.
Read it.	Again?	Read it!
Who told them that?	I have no idea.	Why not?
There is one other matter.	What is it?	I have a letter, ma'am.
Nick, Alex, how are we today?	How'd you know it was us?	Security camera.  Pulled your files before I came down. Be careful what you say, kids #  I know where you live.
Sick?	Everybody's sick, huh?  It's fifteen after.  We always meet here, you know that.	What's her problem?
Liar.  Did you come from the city on the left, or the city on the right?	I came from the city on the left.	But you always lie, so you didn't come from there.  That means the city on the left must be the City of Truth.
I have to talk to you.	We are talking# 	No, in person.  Now.
Can you turn off the game?	I'm in the middle of it# 	Turn if off!
Something's happened to them.	It's the middle of the night.  They're asleep.  Phone didn't wake them.	All of them?
We have to find out what's happened to them. I think they're gone# 	No way.	If they're sick, great.  But let's make sure.  Come on, Nick.
Anywhere.  We have to stop it from getting out.	It's already out.	The Police, then# 
You mean we learn the rules# 	And beat it at it's own game.	You realize that in order to do that, we'd actually have to play the game.
You don't get it, do you?	What?	I don't want anything to happen to you.  I care about you.
Okay.  Give us a kiss?	One.  In case# 	Don't even say it.
Our time's up.	What?!  There's nothing here!	Look around# 
How did you get here?  Did you play the game?!	Yes# 	Thought so.
What did he do to you?	Is that your question?	Wait!  No!  That's not it!
Mom?  You're alive# 	Of course I am.	But I don't understand# 
So start at the beginning# 	Give her a chance, will you?	I am giving her a chance.  Why don't you get off my back?
Ray did #  and then they closed the set# . everybody's gone. You'd better get down here Adam!	No.	You've got to talk to Ray you've got to fix this.
Someone's shut off my money!	I know.  Where are you Adam?	What do you mean "you know"?
It will work out.	Good then, but, just in case, that bank's gonna stay closed a bit longer. You understand that?	I understand.
Your Aunt called me.	I was afraid of that.	She wants to know who's staying in her apartment.
Get going. You don't want to be late.	Right. See ya.	Good luck, honey!
A car #  a car accident.	Are you okay?	I think so. I was just taking a shower.
No.	But, this could be serious.	No# I need to sleep.
Well#   what do you think about then? I mean#   well what do you think about?	What do you mean?	Well #  if you don't remember anything, I mean what goes through your mind then if you don't remember anything?
Strange to be calling yourself.	Maybe it's not me.	Call the number.
What's wrong with that?	I'm not sure about this.	I know you're afraid of something. We'll be careful. Tomorrow we'll go over there and we'll find out.
"Really?"	"My parents are right upstairs! They think you've left# "	"So#  surprise"# 
Don't stop!	What is it? What do you see?!	Those men in front, in the car.
I don't think# 	C'mon help me in. I'll open the front door.	No.
You're so easy.	Gotta keep an eye on her, that's all.	Yeah, what for?
Hey ! Hey ! I'm talking to you !	What ?	You took an awful big risk back there.
So you're telling me you were set up ? I knew something was wrong.	I'm not listening.	Hey ! I'm still your best chance to get out of here alive.
So why this ?	Excuse me ?	Why did you build this whole place ?
What are you DOING here ?	I work here, remember ?	That was eleven years ago.
Is it over ?	Almost. Look, you two get out of here.	Where ?
Look ! Look !	Shit, I forgot about them. Well, I guess the boss man wasn't as tough as I thought.	I don't know. Maybe we should watch the tape to be sure.
What the #  ?	What happened ?	The power went out in half the park.
Hello.	Hi. I brought some wine.	Thank you, won't you come in ?
What now ?	I want to go to sleep for about a month.	No, idiot. Where do we go now ?
THANK YOU.	Don't mention it.	I don't even know your name.
You were just having a fight about me. Wouldn't you like to hear my opinion?	Of course.	I think that if I'm old enough to accept a new baby, and if I'm old enough to accept a new room, I'm old enough to go to California.
I'm glad you're here.	You are?	Yeah, come on, let's talk.
Hi.	Come on in!	That's okay.
Hello.	Hi.	What can I do for you?
Thanks# .	No THANKS!	He said it was a gift.
Don't forget, the girls change their names if they got married.	I'd never do that.	Get married?
Hey relax, I'm not gonna break it.	Give it to me!	Come and get it.
What's he smoking?	What do you think?	Really?
Right.	And you'd be my cousin?	Yeah I guess# sort of.
What's that?	Ten bucks.	What's it for?
So what's wrong?	Nothing, nothing at all.	I mean# with your car.
Good morning.	Well maybe for you.	Something wrong?
Oh no, I, I# eh# I couldn't.	You couldn't?	Well I'm sort of involved.
Hey, you didn't pay me!	How do I know you were gonna show us one?	You're such a baby.
Can't you see it?	No.	It's there.
Excuse me, what about the job?	Pardon?	I need the job.
Hi.	Oh Hi, what can I do for you?	Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing.
Yeah.	Are you mad at me?	No, why?
Dance with me?	Here?	This is where we are.
Do you want to?	Want to what?	Kiss me.
Watch you don't knock out a fish.	Perfect.	I don't know which ball's mine.
Daddy, can I have thirty five dollars?	That's a lot of money for a little girl.	It's for school, for summer writing class.
Dad?	I love this guy! 	Dad??
I found this.	I forgot about that picture, where did you find it?	In the garage.
Oh yes, oh that's great.	I'm very nervous.	Why?
I paid the money.	For this class?	Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
Cause she's dying.	Do you think she is?	No.
Shut your big fat mouth!	I think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask your Dad?	He won't give it to me.
Did you read ALL these books?	Uh huh.	What are they about?
How old are you?	I'm eleven and a half.	It's okay, come on upstairs, we have to have a little talk.
No, I'm going home.	Why? It's not dinner time yet.	Dinner time?? You're like a dog! You just go home to eat.
Is that your Dad?	Yes.	Who's that with your Dad?
Here.	Don't DO that!!	Sorry.
Can we go yet?	Go???	You know I'm not allowed outside my myself after dark.
Run faster they're after us!!	I am running faster!!	Hurry!!!
Jump in the water!!	But I have my clothes on!	Do it!
So now you'll have a mother.	I don't like her.	I do, she's real funny.
Like this?	Uh huh.  Okay, enough practice.	Close your eyes.
Just do it.	Okay, okay.	Okay on the count of three.
So#  one almost has to# 	Exactly.	Exactly what?
Well, sure.	But they're so down to earth, such wonderful people# 	You've met her parents.
This is her family and her fault.	And your point?	Well.  How come she didn't# 
I never forgot that.	It's two weeks.	Almost three.
You got the money?	Right here.	Well, don't lose it. Last time I gave you twenty-five dollars, you lost it.
You want anything?  A drink?	Oh, no, listen, I don't want to take up too much of your time.	Don't you worry. We're just having a quiet Sunday at home.
Mr. Green?	Yes, ma'am. How are you today?	Didn't you get?#  How are you?
Yes, sir.	Can I help you?	Yes, sir. I need a room
I'd really like to see you.	Or course. You should come over to the house. The boys would love to meet you.	That's not quite what I had in mind.
Hello.	Wow!	What?
Stay.	I can't.	Car pool?
When did you think it would happen?	I'm not sure.	I knew when I first met you.
How old are you?	Older.	Thirty?
I'll talk to you tomorrow.	That's what you said before.	I know. Goodbye.
All I need is fifteen minutes a night.	Fifteen minutes?	Sleep. That's all I need. Don't want to waste no time sleeping. You married?
Sorry I'm late.	You're not.	Where's Bill?
You know Bill is really mad at you.	Oh?	I mean# 
Come on back to bed.	Yeah, you bet. You're really terrific. You know what I mean?	Come on.
Say something.	What?	Anything.
How is it?	Not good.	Do you have a back up.
Sorry about that.	Don't worry about it.	We're about ready to go here. Are you ready?
Mickey, can I talk to you alone?	No.	This is crazy. You can't escape like this.
I can't go. I'm too fucked up.	I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt, but$ 	I can't run with you, Mickey! I really want to. If I could, I would, but I can't. I gotta stay here. But you can still get out of here.
Where' you goin'?	Out.	Want me to come?
Thanks.	Would you like me to say anything tomorrow?	Guess so.
That's two bucks, Joe.	Why don't you come over for a beer when you get through?	Okay, I will.
Haven't seen you around, have I?	No. I'm new in town.	You working?
Oh yeah?	You work around town?	I'm a teacher.
Ain't your fault.	That's the way he is.	Yeah. It's just like I figured.
How old is your boy?	Four.	What's he like?
How did it go?	What?	Your boy.
I can see why.	Well, what d'you think?	It's okay with me, baby. But how' you goin' to like it?
What about him?	He could live with us.	Let's just see how the two of us make out first, huh?
You know how to box?	Uh-huh. Why?	My kids want me to teach them.
Like so. There you go. Okay, hit me!	I don't want to hurt you.	Go on - hit me!
Hi.	Don't ask, baby - huh!  How much money you got with you?	About ten dollars.
Ain't you goin' to say something?	There's nothing to say.	Well, that'll be the first time.
Where're you going to go?	When I get set, I'll send for you.	I don't think that'll happen.
Couldn't get the words out before.	Better get him to a hospital.	Didn't I tell you to beat it - huh?
Want to come up the house? You can stay there till you get on your feet. There's no point paying a hotel.	No thanks, Lee.	It's just that I hate empty rooms.
Hello.	How are you?	All right, son.
Come on, Will.	What's the matter?! You mad at me?	No. Why?
Now you stay put!	I ain't drunk, honey.	Like hell you ain't!
Peter said you came to kill us. Is that true?	No. I only needed the code from you.	Then we would have talked, you and I.
Yo.	How's the ice break?	Slow, but good. I got a nice safe blind spot going. C'mon.
Hello, Case.	I thought you already left.	Flight's in the morning. You should be on it, too. There's nothing for us here, Case. There never was.
How many times have I fired her?	Five$  Six$ 	Eh.
What!?	Do you remember high school?	It was a long time ago -
Yes.	Didn't I tell you?  I'm always right, you know, my dear#  Aren't I?	Yes.
You're mine, you know.  I made you.	I know.	If you went away, what would become of me?
I do the best I can to make it comfortable for us here.	I know.	But I guess my best just isn't good enough.
Taste it.	But why?  It's your lunch. There isn't much there in the first place.	Taste it.
Help me with this thing!	It's not the gas, Dad!	Don't tell me it's not the gas!
Jesus Christ, you scared the shit out of me!	I'm sorry# 	What are you doing here?
You okay?	Yeah, yeah, sure.	Let me look at your eye# 
What is it - What's wrong?	Whoa!	What is it?
You should eat something - you'll feel better.	I'm not hungry.	I wish you'd talk to me.  We can figure it out, you know.  We can figure it out together.
I think I better go.  I'm just not into it tonight.  I'm sorry.	Why won't you talk to me?	Will you leave me alone?  Please.
So, school going alright?	Okay, I guess.	Making friends?
Morning.	How'd you sleep, honey, okay?	Fine.
What's that?	We're gonna stay out of your way tomorrow night.	You're going out?
Are you crazy?  You'll wake the whole neighborhood!	Hi Mom.	Don't "hi Mom" me.  What are you still doing up?  It's past one!
Honey, you'll wake the whole neighborhood!	Mom?	What are you still doing up?  It's past one.
Can we talk?  Just for a minute?	Can't it wait till morning?	Please Mom?  I just don't want to be alone.
Girl, what are you doing?	Watching TV.	I can see that. You watch too damn much TV.
It was great seeing you again.  I'm glad you dropped by.	Do you still# see each other?	Yes.  I'm going to see her tonight.
I haven't been able to do that since I was a little girl.	You did it the other night.	That was different.
Well, if it isn't my little girl#  come to visit her Daddy.	It's been a long time.	Yeah, but here you are.  How'd I get so lucky?  I thought you were trying to forget I was alive.
You're late.	Didn't get much sleep.	Well, we've got $ 
This is nice.	Never been here before?	Must have opened while I was away at school.
To who?	Doesn't matter.	C'mon.  Let's get out of this rain.
What was that?	What?	Listen.
Would you like a cup of tea before you go?	No thanks.	Coffee?
Oh hi.  Forget something?	I forgot my bag.	Oh right.
So who left who?	She left me.	Why?
Here we are.  Do you want to come up?	There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.	There are lots of reasons.  Do you want to come up?
To be able to do that is such a wonderful thing.	You've got to go.	Why?
You've got big feet.	Yes.  Always have had.	You know what they say about men with big feet?
How are you doing?	How do you think I'm doing?	I don't know what happened.
This is certainly#  ah# 	I only found out you were here yesterday.	I was going to ring#  but#  I didn't think you'd want to# 
Quickly, quickly $  talk very quickly what are you doing here with Anna Scott?	Anna Scott?	Yes.
But she said she wanted to go out with you?	Yes $  sort of# 	That's nice.
By the way $  it's you.	Me?	Yes.  What do you think?
Can I help you?	Yes $  I was looking for Anna Scott# 	Does she know you're coming?
Cool, huh?	Yes $  she might think you don't have true love on your mind.	Wouldn't want that#   Okay $  just one more.
Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.	Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.	Good luck.
I wouldn't go outside.	Why not?	Just take my work for it.
Are you sure you# ?	Yes.	Oh.  Right.
Excuse me.	Yes.	Bad news.
Wait a minute# 	It's okay, Rose. You can go with him.	Oh yeah! Well if ya don't mind, I'll decide on my own date!
Gimme a cigarette!	No!	Why not?
Big king, too bad# 	Just wait till you hear# 	Hear what?
I wanna go home!	Yeah, it's cold!	I'm hungry.
You want me to show ya! You want me to show ya how!	Yeah, yeah, show me. Show me how!	All right!
Bullshit. You ain't got no way out!	Oh, yeah?	Yeah!
Hey, how ya doin'?	Fine, thank you.  Here, please take these.	What are they?
He's a patient, Rose# 	Oh, yeah# 	Yeah# 
Who is he?	He's in charge.	Are you a doctor?
Yeah!	Big man!	Yeah, how much you wanna bet?
What happened?	What's that?	What?
She was your sister.	No, she wasn't my sister.	Your mother.
Great.  Because, like I said, until you find it, we can't let you on the plane.	You don't understand.  The man I'm supposed to marry is on that plane.	Okay, ma'am, just a moment.
No#   it's just very important that I find him, okay?	Why?	Because.
So, what's the story with your friend?	My friend has lost her fucking mind# 	What's she doing?
No, really.  What's she doing?	Really.  She thinks he's here. Even though she's never met him. Even though she's never laid eyes on him.	Seriously.
Don't be afraid.  You can tell me.	You're sure# 	We found each other, didn't we?
Who's dying?	Your great aunt.	What great aunt?
I'll bring it back as soon as I can.	But Faith$ 	What?# 
You# 	Hi there# 	Before you start picking your nose, I know he put you up to it.
That's not the point.	You said whatever it was you would understand.	That was before I found out what it was.
How could you do this to me?	I'm in love with you.	Oh, come on#   What kind of an excuse is that?
Why can't you just tell me?	If it's any of your business, yes.	Yes?!  To be married, I suppose.
Uh, I'd rather not say.	Tell me.	I'd really rather not say.
He's out by the pool right now.	Right now?	Oh, and I forgot to tell you.  He's here with his mother.
Hey$ 	What?	Nice dress.
What?# 	What are you doing here?	We were hungry.
Hi.	Hi.  Are you#  busy?	No.  Are you're leaving?
It seems like ever since I found out about this guy, this name, I've been kind of crazy.  Like I was on drugs or something.	I know the feeling.	Yeah#   Well, anyway, I also wanted to tell you, I'm not getting married.
Hello.	Beautiful place# 	Sure is.
Been here long?	Just since yesterday.	I just got here, too.  Not yesterday.  But, just now.  Today. Just a few minutes ago.  Yeah, we just got here#   I mean, I just got here.  I'm single.
I was wondering#   Do you have dinner plans?	Tonight?	Any night.
Wait.	Yes?	Aren't you going to tell me who you are?
Faith, this is my mother.	Oh, hello.	Mommy, this is Faith.
So, what are we waiting for?	What?	Let's face it.  You want me.
No.	Is he married?	No.
I can't believe we came all this way and he's gone.	You gave it your best shot.  You tried.	We lost him?# 
We're saved!	What is it?	A phone message.  Only$ 
Anna, I'm Faith.  You don't know how happy I am to meet you.  You see, I'm trying to find someone, and$ 	Her brother.	Right.  My brother.
What did you say to her?	I don't know.  I just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden$ 	What's she saying?
Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you?	Because I'm the one who's single.	I never even got to be single.
Faith$ 	What?	Good luck.
That was really sweet# 	I meant about my idea.	I think it's time we got some professional help.
Well#  I ought to be getting home anyway.  The kids'll be back from camp soon.  The house is probably a mess.	And Larry?# 	What about Larry?
I'm fine.  Have you seen Peter?	He's gone.  He told me what happened.  He just left for the airport.	Larry, did you rent a car?
No, you don't understand.  It's been wonderful meeting you.  But#  I have a husband.  I have two kids at camp.  I have a life I have to go back to.	You don't have to go if you don't want to# 	But I do want to.
This is the last one before the wedding, right?	Right.	And we didn't have to bring another present?
I have to talk to her.	She's not here.	Where is she?
Oh, it's you.  It's only Peter.	Thanks.	Sorry# 
Right now?	He just got a call from "Mr. Upstairs." Something's gone wrong. He's plenty hot.	I'm gonna take her home first.
Listen, you like beer?	I don't know.	Want to go out and have one with me?
Is Johnny in?	No.	No?
Well we certainly can't stay here. C'mon.	Where?	In there.
I love you Bob. I really do. Forgive me?	There's nothing to forgive. It was all a dream.	You love me then?
They are live ones?	Yes, Master.	Live ones where only the dead should be?
Have we in some way made you angry, Master?	You know better than that.	We don't know of anything, Master# 
You didn't visit him in prison.	He didn't want me to.	Why not?
They found the safe.	You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard?	Yeah, hi.  Nice house.
Come on.	Shit.	What?
Put it down or I'll shoot.	You wouldn't shoot me, would you?	What do you want to bet?
You can live or die, it's up to you.	Oh, is that right?  You going to shoot me?  Nice girl like you?  I don't think so.	You don't, huh?
Quite a mess.	Yeah.  And I thought everyone liked Eddie.	Who?
Soon as we leave here.  Stop home and pick up what we need and go do it.	Give me a minute, talk to Buddy.	You got two minutes, that's all.  Make up your mind.
You don't seem all that scared.	Of course I am.	You don't act like it.
You getting serious on me now?	I'm trying not to.  I just wanna know what's gonna happen.	You know.
I'm sorry, Jack, but I can't shoot you.	You just did, for Christ sake.	You know what I mean.
Tell me something.  What's it like, walk in a bank with a gun, stick it up?	I don't know.  I never used a gun.	Really?
I still haven't made up my mind yet.	What's to think about?	You goin' right back to work?
You were talking in your sleep.	What'd I say?	"Hey, yourself."
He doesn't even look like that.	No?	No, he looks a lot# 
Now listen, it's hands off Billy.  I mean, you can put your hands on him if you want to, but then my hands will break yours.	He was that good?	No, I was.
Didn't you say you told her not to come?	Yeah.	Then why are you looking for her?
Sorry.	Why be sorry?  That's what you feel, it's better to come out with it.	I didn't mean it.
I heard what you did.	We can explain, Colonel.	Explain what?
They're waiting. Come on.	I can't. It's all too much.	Go on. You can do it.
He is kind of cute, isn't he?	Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are.	He does?
But you love me don't you?	Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.	And nothing will ever change that.
Hello, Charlie.	Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?	Fine, thanks. Come on in. I want to talk to you.
Oh yeah. Charlie. How am I going to handle him?	What's the matter? Did you two have a fight?.	Sort of.
What are you doing?	I'm just happy to see you.	Come on! Mom said you were sick. You're never happy to see me.
Jesus.	I don't know what to do, Bob.	You'll never find it in the dark.
What in God's name#  ?	Bob# 	What's wrong with your face?
What's wrong with you?	Close the law book.	I'm not going to close the$ 
I'm ready# 	Ready for what, baby?	Whatever.
Who'd you get?	What?	Find a lawyer?
I'm a law suit.	Not bad.	Get it?
Are you a good lawyer?	I'm an excellent lawyer.	What makes you an excellent lawyer?
Good school. What year?	Second.	Great.
Don't you know this is exactly the kind of bullshit that makes people hate you guys?	Fuck you! You want to kick my ass? You want to try?  Asshole.	You're the asshole, buddy.
I didn't tell the others, I was afraid to# 	#  But now, we're standing up for ourselves# 	#  But we shouldn't have fired him# 
As fast as you can.	You sure you can keep $ 	As fast as you can.
Hey.	Hey, who?	Hey, me. Over here.
And him?	Big Evil?	We just keep him locked up forever?
They're afraid of our light. That means we don't have to be so afraid of them.	And you're certain you can find the way back? Even in the dark?	No, I'm not. But he can.
Fuck me. You said "clear."	Said "looks clear."	Well, what's it look like now?
Do you have to work tonight?	No.	Neither do I.
That's Bright Eyes. The one I was telling you about.	What's so special about him?	Watch.  Hello, Bright Eyes. How's our throat today?
I told you not to bring the other one.	He wouldn't leave her.	All right#   Get in# hurry.  Put this on.
You can have the table yourself, if you'd rather. I'm only killing time.	No, please.	Sit down then. We often have a double up here.
They'll know whether he killed himself.	I don't.	How did you meet him?
You tried to run away.	There wasn't any plane.	It's always a mistake to run away. Always.
Cold?	Is this the best you can do?	At this time of night. It's not as bad as it looks.
Want to dance?	Dance? Here?	Why not?
It still doesn't matter if I kiss you?	Nothing matters.	No use waiting, then.
That's the second round I've lost tonight.  That fellow hurt me.	So have I.	From you, I like it.
I decided I didn't want a drink# I'm beginning to wonder.	Wonder what?	If you're doing all this just for me.
In a way.	If it was an accident, you could have told the truth.	So could you.  But our records were a little against us.
What this?	Yes.	Where's you get it?
You won't tell me who you are? You won't even give me a chance to help you?	Nobody can help me. You, least of all.	If I understand what you meant by that.
This isn't a very good place to talk.	I don't want to talk.	I've come here to arrest you for murder.
You've got a couple of hours, maybe.	To do what?	I can't answer that.
Could be.	I rather thought so. And before that, had you ever seen the gun?	No.
In case you want to have us followed.	I don't.	Well$ good night.
I had a father who knew how to steal.	What?	You asked me where it all came from.
What are you doing here?	I don't think you locked your door.	What do you want?
Get out of here!	What are my orders, sir?	You think I'm wrong about this bit of a girl.  Go out and prove it against me!
What's this?	What does it look like?	How long have you had it?
How's Mary?	She's fine.  Well, actually we've broken up.  It's all over.	No.  That's terrible, Charles. What happened?
Why not stay?	I have to be up early. 	Me too.
You don't trust me.	I don't trust anyone.  That's what comes of working in television.	In radio we're different.
Look, will you come on a walk with me tomorrow?	I might.	Might?
That's enough of that.	We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake.	Far too long.
Hello.	Hello.	I'm waiting for your mother.
Hello, Jimmy.	Dad.	Come into the kitchen.  I'm just making your mother's tea.
I've got to be going.  I've got a meeting tonight.	The bed's all made up if you want to stay.	I'll ring you in the next couple of days.
We'll see what we can do.	Promise?	Promise.
Don't you want to walk, Tom?	No.	Actually, I've been once today already.  I'll stay here with him.
Go on, Johnny.  Pull it.  But you gotta drop the gun, first!  Right?! You use your other hand what you gonna hold on with?	Pull it right now or I'll blow your fucking head off and pull it myself!	Well that's the only way it's gonna happen, man.  Do it!  Come on, you want to do it.  You're gonna die, Johnny.  Five more seconds.  Four# 
You sure he isn't out back?  You mind if I go take a look?	Look, I don't know anything about your dog, okay$ 	Well is there anyone else here that might have seen him?
The hell are they?!	They took a left at the next light!	You sure?!
Who's the girl?	Catch of the day.	Oh, oh.  That sounds personal.
I#  I gotta go.	Johnny#  what's going on?  I don't get it#  did I do something?	No.  I'm sorry.  I have to go. I'll, uh#  I'll call you later. I'm sorry.
What the hell do you think you're doing?	We're going to need everyone.	What are you talking about? We'll be out of here in ten minutes.
You lift off in three hours.  There's one other thing.	What's that, General?	Someone else will be going in with you.
Your uncle will like this.	He's not really my uncle.	They never are, dear.
Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date?	What's that?	You looking' for some company?
Get in.  This side.	What?	You know how to drive a stick?
Let's talk some more first.	Right.  So!  In town on business?	Uh-huh.
Good morning.	You didn't wake me.  I'll be out of here in a minute.	No hurry.  Would you like some breakfast?
Do you ever#  enjoy it?	I like guys if that's what you're asking.  Not that I trust'm.	No?  Why's that?
All right.  How much for the week?	What?	I'm in town until Saturday.
It'd cost you.	Of course.  How much?	Five full nights#  days too?
You're upset, huh?	Upset.  No.  I never get upset about business.	You liked the guy, though.
I still don't understand why you only bought one dress.	I wasn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be.	Why not?
Okay.	Good.	Come with me?
You always been rich?	No.	Seems like it.  I guess it's easy to get used to, huh?
One more night and you're finally rid of me.	Yeah, you've been pretty tough to take.	I have to go to New York tomorrow.
What's up, where you going?	Give me your car keys, will you, I'm going back to my hotel.	At least stay for a drink.  This party's for you.
Yes, I'm glad you're clean but I've been calling and calling.	Was that you?	Who did you think?
I'm just going to my room.	You're a guest here?	I'm $  I'm with a friend.
You have beautiful things.  How much is this?	I don't think it would fit you.	I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how much it was.
What is with you?	Excuse me?	I'm going to spend money.
Yes?	Do you remember me?	No, I'm sorry, I don't.
I fear I'll never see you again.	Of course you will.	But what if something happens to you?
Can you move at all?	Move? You're alive. If you want, I can fly.	I told you, "I would always come for you." Why didn't you wait for me?
Give her to me.  Catch up with us quickly.	What do I do?	Finish him, finish him. Your way.
Hello.	It's you.	True!
You don't look so good.  You don't smell so good either.	Perhaps not. I feel fine.	Yeah?
I brought you a special present.	What is it?	Open it up.
$  all that I have and more please $ 	$  offer me everything I ask for $ 	$  anything you want $ 
You feeling any better?	A little bit.	Guess what.
Yes, what?	What you were saying.  Keep talking.	What was I saying?
Assume away!	Well, it's very easy.  You simply raise more money than you really need.	What do you mean?
Will you get a hold on yourself.	Don't touch me!  Don't touch me!	What are you afraid of?  I'm not going to hurt you!  What's the matter with you?
Okay.  I'm way over here.  Is that better?	It's a little better, but you still look angry.	How's this? 
It won't run a week!	Run a week?  Are you kidding?  This play has got to close in the first act.	Who wrote it?
Of course, the check, I had it with me all the time.	I don't know what's happening to me. I must be getting old.	Is it all right?  I made it out to cash.  You didn't tell me the name of the play.
Why?	Must've needed it.	What are you talking about?  What is this?
She stole some money.	A lot?	Forty thousand dollars.
Mary had been there, one night, and had left.	With the forty thousand dollars?	He didn't mention the money.  What he said on the phone isn't important, is it?  He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! That's what I want you to do something about!
Yes?	May I talk to you?	Sure# 
Is something wrong?	I want to know if my sister is here.	Here?
What should I know?	To begin with, where Mary is. Do you?	No. I take it you don't either?  How long?
What thing?	Huh?	What thing could we be in together?
Probably on his way back right now.	Sam, I'm going.	You'll never find it.
No, thank you. It's my problem, too.	I don't know where to start#   Except at the beginning.	Yes.
I wonder if we'll ever see Mary again.	Of course we will.	Alive.
Sorry.	Hospital clean.	What?
May I see your license?	Why?	Please.
I've been doing all the talking so far, haven't I?	Yes.	I always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance. Yet there you are, doing all the listening!  You are alone here, aren't you?  It would drive me crazy.
What made you steal? Are you hungry?	No$ I don't want to give any money. Everybody wants money$ I'm not going to give any money.	Who wants your money$  maybe I can help you.
What is it now?	I'm losing my blood!	You're losing your blood?
Your father?	Yes!	The master #  is asleep!
The child!	Yes.	There's no child here.
There's no child here, and no dogs either.	No?	No!  Good night!
You didn't happen to be going to Worth's place, did you?	No, sir, I'm sure it wasn't there.	You used to go to Worth's place a whole lot. What makes you sure it wasn't there?
What was her name?	Excuse me???	What was her name?  The one I met.
Could we go somewhere?	I'm heading out of town.	Okay.
Could you?	Where to?	A place you've never been.
Yes?	Is Rose here?	She must have gone out for a walk with the children.
You better quit that.	But Rose# 	I must be outta my mind. Buddy, quit it.
Buddy, you wouldn't tell nobody, would you?	Don't worry, Rose, I won't tell a soul.	I sure hope you don't.  I gotta get outta here, good night.
What's goin' on?	Rose says she's goin' to have a baby and she sure looks it, but I don't think so.	A baby#  and she isn't even married.
Why Rose? Why Rose, Daddy?	Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd want to?	That's a hell of a thing to say. Why, Rose?
All right, all right. Now calm down, Rose, the children will hear you. Calm down, let's talk#  about this thing, let's discuss it.	Don't make me#  me#  me#  get up!	Calm down, Rose, let's calm down and discuss it # 
Rose, what are you doing up?	Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.	Is anything wrong?
Nothin'. I got myself up, that's all.	Got yourself up?	Yeah. I'm goin' out.
And who, Rose, may I ask, is that?	Well, it's Billy.	And what, may I ask, was Billy doing here?
What baby? What baby? What baby are you speaking about?	Mine.	Your baby?
You see, Rose? Now that's the kind of dress you ought to wear.	Yeah, it's kinda nice.	You look very pretty in it, Rose. Really, you do.
Let me tell him.  Let him decide.	You're not gonna see him again.	What#  what makes you think you can order me around?!
I can work this.	No you can't.	Get ready.
This is too fast.  This is way too fast!	Relax.	We should slow down.
They#  they shot me.	They shot us all, kid.	What day is it?
We got him.	Slow down.	"Go, go, go!"  "Slow down."  Make up your mind.
Been waiting long?	Just got here.	How'd we do?
I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.	He wasn't. I can feel it.	You love him, don't you?
Yes.	Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful little cook.	Yes.
Yes Brad.	I've got something to say.	Uh huh.
You did right.	A decision had to be made.	You're OK by me.
On the day I went away.	Goodbye	Was all I had to say
Y'know how I said that stuff on television didn't bother me?	Yes.	It did.
# Can't do it.	# What?	# I can't beat him.
My side.	Get that doctor.	No doctor!
I don't like ya face.	Don't like yours neither.	Kiss my ass.
A hundred an' thirty.	That's it, I'm broke.	That's it? $  Completely?
Buddy's got a thing against ya, Rock. Some people just hate for no reason, y'know.	Yeah.	Here's fifty bucks $  You an' the girl have a nice time.
Did these guys teach you to talk dirty? Huh?	Hey $ 	What?

How old are ya?	# What?	How old?
How am I doin'?	Real good.	See how fast he is $  damn!
Wanna keep goin'?	Would you keep goin'?	# Yeah.
Problem my ass!  I think you're lying to me, and if you are you're a dead man!	Would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there?	Nothing.
I better be getting that.	Duty calls?	Just business.
Go ahead, shoot#  Shoot and kill the bitch, I don't care.  And yet you don't shoot.  Interesting. Put down your weapon and walk away.	Don't do it, Sam!	Shut up!
Do you have it?	Not so fast.  Who's that?	He's company.
What are you doing?	Don't cross me# 	Nobody's going to do that!
He's tough, your American friend.	Yes, Sam's tough alright.	And you respect him.
Some, thanks.  Enough to move on, for now.	You should really let a doctor look at that.	Soon.
Sorry I'm late# 	What makes you think we're here to meet you?	Who else would you be?
Where to?	To see a man about a thing.	I can do that.
What's going on?	I just wanted to see something.	See what?
It was at that.	A lot of people died.	I've seen a lot of people die before.
What the fuck happened?	I don't know# 	You don't know?  Bullshit, you had her, there was no way out.
Give me a cigarette.	Right now?	Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
I'm not here very much.	Business keeps you on the road?	Something like that.
I know I don't need to say this to you, but I need to say it to you.  This is my job, I have to do it.	So I do it.	No you don't, and you know it.
Time to quit.	Just like that?	Not just like that#  Just before I turn around and it's six months from now and the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is light a cigarette.
Let's get him out of here# 	Finish the job# 	And now# 
My man, how you doing?	I'm alright.  And you?	Doing well.  This is?
Ten thousand right here.	There must be over a million dollars in here.	Shit, more than that.
We're dead.  We're dead, We are dead#   What are we going to do?!	I don't know# 	This isn't a joke. What are we going to do!
I could kill that no good son of a bitch!	All right enough!  I'm tired of thinking about all this!	Well I'm not!  Thinks he's got us by the balls.
It's too late# 	It's NOT too late!	Yes it is.  I'm calling it in.  Right now.
Ah hell, he'd do the same for me.	Has he?	No.  But he would, probably.
Hi.	Hi.	Heard you had quite a night.
What's wrong?	Nothing.	Nothing's wrong.
Like hell it's over.  You told me he wasn't doing this anymore.	He's not, he's# 	That son of a bitch.
Yeah, I've seen him.	What did he buy?	I don't remember.  We get a lot of people in here.
I have a better plan.  You want to hear it?	What?	I have a better plan.
And what's that?	How about you give us what you have and leave.	What?
I'm not asking.	Well you're not getting, either.	Listen -
Don't you want it?	Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough.  Besides, I want you to have it.	Well I don't know $ 
Oh, you American?	That's right.	You bring American money?
Hello.	How you doin'?	My friend is on vacation, from America. I want to show him a good time.
What are you doing?	She said I could pick any girl I want.	Well, hurry up.
It sounds impossible $ 	You said $ 	$  but if somebody gave me the chance to square up my father's death, I'd go to hell to do it.
You want to figure out why they killed your Daddy, get on the plane.	Why LA?	I guess you're going to have to trust me on this one.
Slow down, baby.	What did you say?	Nothing.  I said nothing.
Pick it up!	It's your turn!	I don't need a turn!
Wait!  There's people down there!	There's people up here!	Get it out of here!
Are you okay?	What's the first thing I told you $  never trust nobody.  How could you fall for that shit?  I knew she was dirty.	She saved our lives.
Why didn't you tell me you had a bomb in your mouth?	I did!	No you didn't!
They owe us, man.  That's the least they can do.	This money is evidence.	Come on, Lee.  Stop being a cop for five minutes and live it up.  There must be something you want.
You speak English!	A little.	Bullshit a little.  You lied to me.
Oh no.	What?	The art.
Oh my god# what happened to you?	It's called a dress.	It's called you're gonna kill me. What're you doin' with that on?
You OK?	We saved the girl and got the bad guys, didn't we?	Yeah. So why you look do down?
My daughter.	She's fine.	Can I speak with her?
Yes.	You have what I asked for?	I do.
Look $  I'll be in there later today. I'll come by and tell you all about it.	You're coming here?	Yeah.
Of course we are.  Of course.	Then you'll be my best man.	Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.
I have no idea what I'm doing.	Your job is#  the ring.  Do you have the ring?!	I just found out I'm best man!  I'm lucky I have a suit#  What's wrong?
I don't know.	You don't know.	No.
I don't know, give me a minute.  Are you all right with this?	Excuse me?	Are you all right with this?  You think this is funny?
About a minute# ?	A little longer for me.	Really?
Yes, you!	Well, you do have the dress.	And the church.
Used?	They're mine.  I'm turning in my running shoes to you.	This is getting serious.
I'm going to kill myself.	Why?	Because you think I'm all like#  "Hey man, check me out".
There's no why, Annie.  I'm just not up for it.  I never said I was.	Is there somebody else?	Nope.
They loved you.  I told you they would love you and they did.	I love you.	I love you, Walter.  Did anyone ever call you anything other than Walter?
Oh!	What?	Look!
You should write something about this.	About what?	Whatever it is.
What was that about up there?	What was what?	What's with you?
Hello.	Turn on your radio!	What?
I thought I would look into doing a story about those radio shows.	You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.	Definitely.
You told a lie and got on a plane.	That's not what I mean.  I'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him.  I am.	Okay.  Good.  Goodbye.
You're going to miss the train.	No, I'm not. 	What are your plans in New York?
You touch her for the first time, and suddenly#  you're home.  It's almost like# 	Magic.	Magic.
You don't like the one he was now?	He doesn't have one now. That's the problem.	Where's your mom?
Dad $ 	What is it?	There's somebody on the phone for you.  His name is Sam.
Dad?  About last night?	It's never happening again. Right?	Right.
Fine.  Fine.	So I can go.	Sure.  Looking good.
Did you call that radio station again?	No.	Everyone at work heard you.
What if I couldn't get to you?	I was scared of what you were gonna do.	When I found you?
Maybe we'll get a dog when we get back.	Okay.	What do you mean, okay? Wouldn't you like a dog?
Hi.	Hi.  Sam?	Yes?
I thought you were never going to call me.	You did?	I really wanted you to call me, and I thought you were never going to $ 
What were they saying? About you? In there?	They say I am no good to you.	You are no good to me $  in jail.
Let them take it!	Over my dead body.	I don't want your dead body. I don't want you back in jail either.
How do you feel?	I'm okay. But it's nice to be home.	Four nights. How did you sleep?
We've got to have a talk, you and me.	All right, but later. I've got a meeting now.	A meeting?
Tell me.	We can't go on this way. I just can't go on living with you. Not this way.	No. We can't can't go on this way. We can't go back to the old way either.
What are you doing here?  Something wrong with Mama?	I thought maybe you forgot# 	Forgot what?
I wanna do a small buy first.  Ten thousand.  We'll see how it goes.	Why? The guys is ready to deal now.	Because I don't know him and I don't really know you, partner.
Yeah.	Everything go?	Yeah.
What about the guy on the very bottom?	Leave me out of this.	That bad, huh?
What?	Nothing.	Go ahead.
Why don't you call the cops?	Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.	That's long enough to get out of town.
Who is it?	It's me.	I'm kind of busy.
No, you're wrong, I tried to tell myself the same thing but I could have gotten up. I could have done something.	They would have killed you too.	Nothing could be worse then this slow death I'm living now.
Will you do that?  Then I want you to get out of the room.	Why?	Don't worry about it. Just go across the street and watch. You'll know when it's safe to go back.
Where to?	I know a guy.	Lead the way.
You know, Jimmy, you might as well put a sign on the back of this thing asking the cops to pull you over.	You mean, like to throw 'em off?	Yeah, that's what I mean.  Where the hell does this guy live anyway?
Okay	Wait till I tell you what it is.	It don't matter. I'll do it. And you sure as hell don't have to pay me.
You're serious?	Anything for a dear friend.	But I just met you.
You want to do this some other time?	Pull your pants down.	I'm sorry?
Jimmy?	Who the hell is Jimmy?	He's the only one I told.
What's that smell?	That would be me.	What'd you do, piss your pants?
Sir, I'm sorry about what happened, I# 	It was nothing.	But you could have gotten killed and I# 
Good luck, Captain.	Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.	The men said, nine.
Uh, Captain# 	PUSH!	Uh, Captain# 
Up.  We're moving out.	I thought you said we had an hour, sir?	Well now I'm saying we're moving out.  Get off your ass.
Hi.	Is it a gift for your wife?  Are you getting a set together? 	No, I'm not married.  It's for my daughter.
I'm sorry, but they turned down your card.	Oh yeah, let me give you another card.	Okay, thanks.
Keep it.	You're sure?	Yeah, I don't want it.  Um, thank you very much.  You're very kind.
Look at those eyes.	Lloyd, give it up.	Do me a favor; take a picture of me with her.
You are such a great person Lloyd.  I'm a good person, but you are a great person.	Hang in there, man.	Yes.
Alright.	Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter.  Something.	I already did.
No, you're not a guy.	I am.	The world is full of guys.  Be a man.  Don't be a guy.
Wait a minute.	You've got to show her respect, you've got to show her that you're not like Joe# 	Wait a minute.
Visit her at the home.	I'm not going back there.  I don't even know who you're talking about.	Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?
What?	I just had a phone call.	Tell me, is it bad news?
Morning.	Dad, I'm sorry.	You should be.
Lloyd?	Dad, yes.  And I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now.	Sit down.
What happened to you?	Dad, did you do it?  Did you take that money?	Sweetheart, no.  Don't be ridiculous.
Hello.	Hi.	I don't know what to say to you, except goodbye.
Whoa.	Would you hold this for me?	Yeah
Alright, this is some of the things they wrote me; "Glad I finally met you", "You always seemed nice", "Wish I could have known you more"# 	Mine say stuff like "Lloyd, see you around maybe"	Nobody knew me before tonight.
It's just you and your dad, right?	Yeah, but that's an old story, you don't want to hear it.	Sure I do.
Nice one.	Yeah?	I think you should wear that.
After work?	I usually have a break after the dinner service, if you want to stop by.	Won't you see me later?
Yes.	What did you say?	Well#  just meet her.
I think that we should spend some time apart.	What's wrong?	Well, I need to study, and# 
Okay, what did we just decide?	We decided# 	'Cause I'm worried, did you just break up with me?
What do you want?	I'm sorry.	What do you want?
Okay, I'll give here the message.	Okay. She's really pretty great, isn't she?	What?
Thanks Lloyd.	How do you pay for one of those?	Well, we pay for the [?].  That guy didn't want to part with it, a little matter of nine thousand dollars.
She wouldn't get out of the car.  I brought her all the way here, she said she was going to come here, and she wouldn't get out of the car.  But I thought that is was important, that she come to see you, because I know that if you go somewhere and you don't deal with your family stuff, then you're just gonna, she's gonna, um# 	Are you going to England with her Lloyd?	That's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about sir.
Lloyd, everybody in that party put something down on their record except you.	How many people really know what they want though?  I mean, a lot of them think that they have to know, right? But inside, they don't really know, so, I don't know.  But I know that I don't know.	Hang tough, Lloyd.
Oh, I was just going to# 	A very responsible young man you're out with tonight.	I was gonna# 
What's your name?	Sir, the list is correct.	I didn't ask you about the list, I asked you your name.
I go to work the other day, there's nobody there.  Nobody tells me about this, I have to find out, I have to go in, everybody's gone -	They're not gone, they're here.	They're mine!
If you admit to making three, then it's four, actually.  But how?	I just told you.	You did, but you didn't.
What are you doing?	I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.	I mean where have you been? Nobody's seen you around for a while.
Thank you.	I need a drink.	Oh, God, you don't have a drink?
I could try to read this or I could eat my lunch while it's till hot.  We're doing well?	Yes.	Better this month than last?
You think I don't know what you're doing? You're so quiet all the time?  I know.	Are you losing money?	No, I'm not losing money, that's not the point.
I'll talk to him.	I think it's too late.	Well, I'll talk to somebody.  I'll take care of it.
I know what you're saying, but I don't see the difference.	You don't?  I do.  I see a difference.	You'll lose money.
Don't do that. Hang up# call# 	What? I can't hear you# 	Hang up# call# 
Oh, I'm sorry. My bad.  I thought you were someone else.	That's okay.	Who do you want to speak with? Nobody's here.
I just thought if I saw you face to face, maybe it would help.	Did it?	It helped me realize one thing.
Who are you?	That's not the way we play the game.	I don't play games.
What do you mean?	You are writing another book, aren't you? That's why you're here. The story's not over.	You're getting obvious.
Take it off.	But# 	Now.
You ass.	I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to. It was too easy.	You are so not funny.
Jesus.  Hello?	Hello.	Who is this?
Well what number are you trying to reach?	I don't know.	I think you got the wrong number, buddy.
Listen you sick fuck, is this your idea of a joke?	More of a game really.	What kind of a game?
Where are you?	Closer than you think.	Alright I'm here. What the fuck do you want from me?
Nice to finally meet you, Sidney.	The killer called her.	What?  When?
Where?	She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.	WHERE?
Billy? What the# 	I'm sorry. Don't hate me.	What are you doing here?
You heard me.	Are you serious?	Yeah#  I think so.
Who did you call?	What?	When you're arrested $  you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?
It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE!	Fuck you.	We already played that game. You lost, remember?
Yes.	Who is this?	Who are you trying to reach?
Hello.	Why don't you want to talk to me?	Who is this?
What did you say?	I want to now who I'm talking to.	That's not what you said.
I have to go now.	Wait#  I thought we were gonna go out.	Nah, I don't think so# 
Yes?	I told you not to hang up on me.	What do you want?
Please don't do this# 	Come on. It'll be fun.	No#  please.
I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer.	No it's not. It was Jason.	Afraid not.
Have they found my father?	Afraid not.	Should I be worried?
I'm not here to fight.	Just stay back.	I want to talk to you.
Can you see me right now?	Uh-huh.	What am I doing?
Stop. Right there.	Don't shoot. It's me.	Don't come any closer.
Have you heard?	No, I haven't heard.	There was a second.
Come on.  What are you going to do with yourself out there?	I'll get a job, maybe on a farm.  I'll work on the house.	Can't you feel it yet?  Can't you feel that feeling#  ?  You're not going to be a cop anymore.
And#  and#  and he said#  he asked me if I was married.  And, I could see he had a gun in his hand.	Where was the girl?	What?  What?
Jesus Christ, man, don't shoot me!	Turn around.  Hands on your head!	What the hell's going on?
This guy paid me five hundred bucks to bring it out here.  He wanted it here at exactly seven o'clock.	Put it down.  Put it on the ground.	Okay# 
Here he comes.	What the fuck is going on?	I want you to know, I wish I could have lived like you do.
This is the one thing.	I know.	What if it's not that she's seen something?  What if she's supposed to see something, but she just hasn't been given a chance to see it yet?
Does this make it with you?	Doesn't seem like our man, does it?	You tell me.  I'm new in town.
Are you alright?	I'm fine.	What happened?
Wait#  just wait.	It was him.	You can't go in there.
Think about it# 	What the fuck is wrong with you?	Think about how we got here!
Stay with him.	Wait!	There's no time to discuss it!
Anything#  anything missing or different.	I don't see anything.	Are you absolutely certain?
It's nice to meet you.  My husband has told me a lot about you#  except your first name.	Oh#  um, William.	It's a nice name.  William, I'd like you to meet David.  David#  William.
I mean, you known this city.  You've been here for so long.	It's a hard place.	I don't sleep very well.
She's not a little girl any more.	You've seen her!# She's alive?	I've seen her# and she's alive.
Is it going well?	Very well.	But nothing is happening.
We are lost.	No, it will turn out well.	How will it?
Another little problem.	What do we do now?	The show must you know
Oh my lady, my love!	If they find you here they will kill you.	You can bring them with a word.
I would not have thought it. There is something better than a play.	There is.	Even your play.
Take off your hat.	My hat?	Where did you learn how to do that?
Yes, sir.	Do you understand me?	No, sir.
No.	Think about it.	No.
He's still here.	He couldn't get his car started.	When are you going to let the police know?
Finished.	But not quite.	Is that going to be deep enough?
Don't you worry about that.	Is this necessary?	Yes. Now come on, all or nothing.
That was good.	Can we talk about something?	Not now. I have an idea.
How much did you pay?	I don't know.	How much did you pay?
What? Yes, that's fine.	You're sure? There's lots more.	No, I'm sure, that'll be enough.
You looking for me?	Looking for you? Yes.	What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it?
Who?	Your friends.	I don't know what you're talking about.
That's it, then.	That's all?	Sorry to waste your time.
Alex.	What? What's wrong?	What are you doing?
Leave him alone.	He can't stay up there.	He'll come down. Leave him alone.
Boy, am I glad to see you.	What are you doing here?	We have to talk.
Later. But first $  him.	David?	Exactly. Now I've been thinking $ 
Expecting anyone?	No.	Oh.
You'll wait in the hall?	I'll wait there.	And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police, you'll tell them everything?
Interesting.	I see.	Yeah, well, that's what she said. Interesting. That's why you're here, you see.
So, uh# 	What?	What?
It's OK. There's no problem.	You mean I can have the room?	Well, that's what I said, isn't it?
Two?	Who said there were four?	We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of course, but now, four.
I see.	I doubt it. And these two other people, did they hear anything?	No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.
No, I've never seen them.	You're sure of that.	Yes.
Are you all right?	Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine.	Would you like to talk about it?
Two hundred.	Two hundred pounds?	Two hundred pounds.
Expecting anyone?	What?	Were you expecting anyone? Tonight?
But I bet you didn't say you were going to split on him.	It wasn't like that.	Don't lie to me. Don't treat me like that.
What do we do here, David?	Sorry?	Here.
Hello.	What happened to that guy?	What guy?
What guy that died?	That one, last week.	Here?.
Working nights?	I'm a doctor.	And he's a patient of yours?
Take all the time you like, doctor.	I'm sorry, I've never seen any of them.	Look again if you like.
Don't you think there's too much gold?	It's great.  You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on# 	I don't know, I think# 
We cannot go into this later.	That's okay too.	You make me sick. Just be straight for once in your life.
What're you looking for?	My keys.	I thought you said you weren't going anywhere.

Shut up, it's all right.  Do you want a drink?	No, thanks.	Well, I do.
Where do you want to do this?	Probably the bathroom.	Can't you do it out here?
Well, what do you think?	I'd cut it# 	You would?
Why not?	#  he tried to#  uh#  make it with me.	And?
Sit down.	What are you talking about?	Sit down!

George $ 	Keep moving $ 	Now, George $ 
Honey?	Yeah, baby.	Why am I great?
Will we live together?	We live together now.	But in the same house, you know, one house.
Maybe you don't even like children.	Of course I like children.	You've never even been around one.
Great.	Could I talk to you for a second?	Hey, I'm, you know $ 
Yeah.	I said I wasn't sure if I could go.	Go where?
What do you want?	Your advice!	They didn't offer you the job yet.
When?	When I get off work.	When is that?
What business meeting?	Look at the way I live.	I've been trying to reach you all afternoon. You weren't in the shop. What is this thing tonight?
I've got to get her out of here.	$  go ahead.	$  well aren't you $ 
I don't want to fight, George.	I don't want to fight either. Look#  uh $  I love you.	Bullshit.
How come you took your own car?	I didn't want him meeting me here.	Well that's something.
Yes.	Well, did you get a job out of it at least?	I'd like you to leave now.
$  and take this with you.	Where did this come from?	Who knows, I'm sure you don't $  but if it'll help any, I found it in your bed.
Obviously.	How many?	What do you wanna know for?
Baby, please don't#  I love you.	I don't want to be a fool!#  I want to look them in the eye and say, I know!	Baby, don't do this $ 
What? What? What? What? What?	#  honest. At least you're honest with me.	Does it make you happy?
I wish you'd go now.	That's all you've got to say?	$  yes.
What're you here for?	$  A wash and set.	No.
I wish my son knew what he wanted to do.	Oh yeah?	$  Anything, I don't care what it is, just so it's something.
#  she's very upset# 	What about, tonight?	That, and#  I'll be done in a minute.
I wanna hear about it, George.	Hey, have 'em put me away, or whatever you're gonna do, okay?#  I'm too tired to lie, I'm too tired to tell the truth#  I'm too tired for anything.	I wanna hear about it.
Want a drink?	No thanks.	Have a drink.
You don't have a clean glass in the house.	I know.	I'll have to wash one out.
Hell of a way to treat a business partner, that's all I can say.	Who?	Me!
You really think so?	Yes I do.	I'm finished with her.
You're home.	Yeah.	I'm coming over.
I'd like a drink.	Just a second, I've gotta clean this mess up or the dogs'll have it all over the house.	You ought to get rid of those dogs.
Here.	Aren't you going to have one?	No.
This other couple that we're here with, do you know them very well?	Well#  sure# 	Then maybe you can tell me why George would be going into the ladies room.
What's wrong?	We can't really leave that poor man here alone.	$  he'll never know the difference.
$  I'll get in the back $ 	$  oh no, honey, I'll do that# 	$  there's not much room $ 
Dad?	Yes?	I'm hungry.
Are you having a good time?	Yes, Dad.	Good.  I want you to have a good time.
No.  I'm just a little tired.	Then why don't you go to sleep?	I can't.  I have too much to do.
Yes I do.  I love it.  Don't you?	I guess so.	Good.  I want you to like it here. I wish we could stay here for ever, and ever#  ever.
Did your mother ever say that to you - that I would hurt you?	No, Dad.	Are you sure?
Why don't you want to talk about it?	I'm not supposed to.	Who says you ain't supposed to?
It's so pretty.	Yeah.	I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you?
I'd be glad to do that, sir.  Oh why don't you call me back in about eh twenty minutes?	Thank you very much.  I'll do that.	All right, sir.
It's good to see you.	It's good to be back, Lloyd.	What'll it be, sir?
Eleven thirty - Jesus!	I guess we've been staying up too late.	I know it.
Get him out of here?	Yes.	You mean just leave the hotel?
I# 	I can't really remember.	You can't remember.
Well I#  I think maybe he should be taken to a doctor.	You think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?	Yes# 
Stay away from me!	Why?	I just want to go back to my room.
Stay away from me!	I'm not going to hurt you.	Stay away from me!
Hi.	Hi.	How're you getting on?
What time does the plane leave?	Eight thirty.	Well, that still gives up plenty of time to go over everything first.
But how?	BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH	I think I hear it!
No#  it's fine.	Yes?	Thanks.  A lot.
What?	I#  I brought you something.	A cigarette?
What'd she say?	You blew it $  big time.  She doesn't want you back.	Does she know people are trying to kill me out there?
It's done?	Not#  totally.	What's the problem?
You didn't shoot!	Neither did you!	I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to.
What is it?	Listen.	I hear nothing.
There are no other doors.  This is as far as she could have gone.	It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her.  It is absolutely nothing.	What books?
The things I said to you before#  I was wrong to say them.	No, actually, you were not.  Every word you spoke had truth in it.	What has happened?
You cannot kill what is already dead.	Let her go!	Yes#  yes.  I think I will# 
Go home.	May I see my mother?	You do not want to be here.  Go home to your father.
Did you decide, sir?	What you got that's good to eat?	Well, I guess it's all good.
You know what, by God?	What?	You know what we ought to do tonight?
Leave.	Don't tell me what to do.	Leave.
Are you sure you're okay staying with that woman and boy?	Yes sir.	Do they know about you?
Yes sir.	So, you're really going to stay here?	That boy wants me to.
Jesus, what happened to you?	It looks worse than it is. I'm okay.	What happened?
I finished my story. I thought you might want to take a look at it.	I'd love to.	Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in coming.
And what about for you?	Huh?	What about for you?
Looks like someone forgot a camera.	Yeah, I did.	It's yours?
Two, right?	Uh, better make it one.	You usually get two.
So. Are we ready?	Ready. Any time you are.	I'm all ears.
So you're just going to give up and go home?	I don't have much choice, do I? It's pretty clear she doesn't want me around.	Still, you can't just write her off.
It's for you.	For me? And what am I supposed to do with a paper bag?	Open it.
Well?	Well what?	Aren't you going to say anything?
Mostly what.	You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but I might be able to help.	You don't know me from a hole in the wall.
I don't know.	Is it yours?	Yeah, it might be.
Say, Joe - tonight's the night, isn't it?	I'll say.	I mean, we get paid tonight, don't we?
Yeah - where were you?	With you.	With me?
Hi, Jerry.  Everything under control?	Have I got things to tell you!	What happened?
Good night, Sugar.	Good night, honey.	Honey - she called me honey.
I'm a girl, I'm a girl, I'm a girl -	What did you say?	I'm a very sick girl.
You all right?	I'm fine.	How's the bottle?
I tell you - this is the only way to travel.	You better put on the lights. I can't see what I'm doing.	No - no lights.  We don't want anyone to know we're having a party.
Did he get fresh?	Of course not.  As a matter of fact, it was just the other way around.  You see he needs help.	What for?
Okay, Sugar - all clear.  You better go back to bed.	I might as well stay in there. I won't be able to sleep anyway.	Why not?
The most wonderful thing happened -	What?	Guess!
Anyway, you're going to meet him tonight.	I am?	Because he said he's coming to hear us play - maybe.
I should get going.	Are you sure youe okay?	I fine. I promise.
It was such a long time ago.	Still$ 	If Ed ever found out# .
Where Nick sleeping?	Why, with you.	My mother has a rule about men and women sleeping in the same room without a ring in the picture. She thinks it$ 
You heading to the train station?	I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.	Yeah.
That was a long time ago.	It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.	So, what your point?
What?	It cute.	What is?
Have you ever done anything like this before?	A weekend?	A wedding.
Hello, goodbye, I want you, I hate you. It all just words. None of it means anything. What matters is what you do. You either stay put or you walk away. If you look back, youe not walking away!	Oh, cut the crap!	I just hate seeing you so stuck.
Oh, no. He told you.	You knew?	I so sorry.
Here it is, right here.	That's where we come from first?	That's where we came from first.
David Lee# 	Yes, sir# 	You had a rough time out there tonight $  so you stay home from that school tomorrow.
Where's everybody?	They gone to the field# 	Guess I can't just lay here, then.
Can I go day after tomorrow?	Yes, son. You better get back to bed.	Good night, Mama# 
What's wrong with him, David?	It's the heat.	It's when the heat is so bad, dogs go crazy.
This done happen before. It ain't nothin' $  I just have to wait a minute or two.	Is there something I can do to help you?	Yeah, just stay where you is# 
There, you see?	I see, all right $  It's time for us to get out of this field.	I just got out here!
It's so very cold# 	We can't leave without you!	It's okay, I am done for.
You know I do.	I know.	So what do you say we shut off that light and get close, huh?
Evening.	It can't be.	Excuse me?
What did you say to me?	It's a little late for you to be up.	Look answer my question!
You're certain of that?	Trust me.  Even checked 'em with my own eyes.	All right, I'll give it a shot.
I think I can handle it.	Well, maybe I will.  You sure you don't want anything?	No.  I'm all set.  Thanks.
And what are you going to do?!	I'm going to try and buy you some time.  I can get to the bridge from here.	But how are you going to escape?
What the hell are you doing?	We have room!  Let's go!	What do you mean?  What happened!
Will you marry me?	Marry you?	That's right.  Will you marry me?
Where'd you get this ball?	It's mine.	Who gave it to you?
So, eh, you never saw me. Right?	I never saw you.	Thanks, kid.  Where are you goin' now?
I came here to have a word with your dad.	What do you want with my dad?	Business.
Do you talk with your mom?	It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.	My mom told me not to stay in this town.
It wouldn't bother you if Buzz was in danger, would it?	Nope, I couldn't care less.	I'm sure you wouldn't care if he needed your help, right?
Where are you going?	I think your brother may have already gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car.	Can I come with you?
There's heat coming the door.	Back away then.	Wait a minute $ 
Hold on $ 	What is it?	Any of you get ahead of me $  walk this far up?
Nobody move.	But she's $ 	Nobody move!
Thank you, Colonel.	Captain.	Captain.  Right, forgive me.
Harry's missing.	What do you mean, he's missing?	He's missing.  He's gone.  He left.
You can't just leave Harry down here, sir.	I told you people, nobody goes anywhere unless I say.	But sir $ 
Any sign of Harry?	Nothing, sir.	Fuck him.  What?  Hello?
Yes, sir.	Well, where the fuck is he?	In the ship, sir.
Gimme a report, I want $ 	Ladies and Gentlemen# 	Who is that?  Where's that coming from?
You said something to him, didn't you?	What?	You told him about me?
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.	Your watch.	Oh yes, my watch.  I almost forgot.
What's wrong, Norman?	I'm feeling better.	Are you?
It's getting cold.	You think I'd really drink that?	You don't think I put something in it, do you?
What is that?  What are you doing?	What?	You hear that?
Would it work?	Yes.  And I think we already know it will.	How's that?
Just in time, too.	In time for what?	What?
How are you feeling, Norman?	What?	You holding up alright?
Our answer.	To what?	Time travel.  A black hole.
I can't.  If I had a minute to think, maybe, but I know you're wrong.	Am I?	Look $  we're under a lot of pressure, we're tired, you're not thinking straight.
#  you there?  Norman?	Harry?	Norman, where are you?
We just figured, you know, the three of us $  we need to#  work together through this.	The three of us.	That's right.
Hold on.	Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes.	I heard!  I heard!
You know how to work this thing?	No idea.	Well, press something!
Well, for one reason, we don't have your other five thousand.	Who's going to pay me then?	I think there are some things we should talk about.
I can't see!  How can I fight?	Try to feel it.  Use the Force# 	I can't do it.  I'll get hit.
This isn't going to work.	Why didn't you say so before.	I think I did.
You can't walk me home.	Why not ?	I thought you were going to help Carl.
I'm gonna miss you.	I'll miss you, too, Johnny.	I love you.
C'mon# 	Nah, I don't do that anymore# 	You used to dance# 
Don't talk like that. Get yourself home as fast as you can.	We'll all have dinner. I'll fix your favorite.	Yeah ! We'll talk it out and have a good glass of wine #  and#  well, we love you, son.
Oh, my, what's that ?	Looks like rain.	This time of the year# ?
All dead except one, sir.	Kill the bitch.	Yes, sir.
Mom's expecting you for dinner tonight.	I'll be there.	You bringing your new friend?
I want to rent this one.	Why don't you buy it, only forty bucks.	I have one, but they lost it.
I quit.	You quit.	I quit the movie.
You like my play.	Yes.	Why?
I# 	No, of course, you want to get out of town.	It's# 
# who# ?	Well, I guess I'll# get down to the station.  It was lovely meeting# 	Mister White is# 
Hello.	I thought you had Play Practice.	Don't look good for "Trial of the Heart."
Great.  Who is it# ?	"Room Service!"	Would you go in# 
Don't you think you should put them in water?	Why?	# because if you don't, they die# 
Start?  This isn't a good time.	Oh.  That's alright.  Then I'll come back at a better time.  What would be a better time?	Later on.
You can do it.	Because I'd met someone else.	Oh okay.
Hi.	Hi.	Where you going?
Press still works.	It does?	Did as of last week.
Good morning.	Sleep well?	Yeah, you?
And I might have something important to tell you# 	What is it, a surprise?	That's right# 
Hi!	We had a date.	We did# ?
A jacket for five dollars# I can buy this town for fifty bucks.	You told me that about the last town.	Yeah, but they never made a movie here.
Stay ready.  Stay by yourself in your room.	What'll I do for fun?	Whyn't you learn your lines?
Are you all right# ?	I# 	You got to get out of here# 
No, I# just# just Joe, just Joe# 	Joe, the writer?	Just him and me.
Get him on the phone.	He's on the Island, he'll be back on# 	Get him on the# 
Look.	I feel so close to you# 	Look, look, I like you very much# 
You have to hide.	Who is that# ?	That's my#

Where you off to?	I, uh# I'm leaving.	Why?
Arrest him.	What is the# ?	Arrest him.
Hi.	I'd prefer it if you didn't speak to me.	I# 
I'm looking for the writer.	What the hell are you so down about?	My wife's going to have a baby.
How do they know that, you told them?	No.	What did you say to them# ?
Stop# 	That's what I said.	How are you getting on with these fine people?
You hear that?	Yes, I hear it.	Drive a man to drink.  Took me near half an hour, get across the street yesterday.
I didn't say that.  Why would I say that?	Well Daddy and I were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen.	I don't want that to happen.  Why would I want that to happen?
You wouldn't kiss him, huh?	Not with my mouth open.	Good girl.
Are you afraid for me?  Where I'm going.	Yes.	Don't be.  I'm going.  Where we all go.  Now how can that be bad.
What I meant and perhaps I didn't say it well was you have a great mom.  You don't need another one.  But when you're at this house $ 	This is my daddy's house $ 	This is my house too!
Help me here# 	Uh.  He thinks his nose is too big.  But it's not.	Great.  Big ears, too?
I hate her.  I really hate her.	There you are!	Don't take my picture!
Are you here?	I'm here.	Because you don't really seem here.
It's going to be hard for the kids when I tell them# I'd like you to be there.	To make it easier for them or you?	It's a huge moment in their life $ 
You bet you are.	How the hell would you know?	I don't, but# 
Now we're going to have a fight, you and I.	Are we.	And I'm going to win.
I love Luke, I love the children. But there is more to life than even love# 	No, there isn't.	And I have looked down the road. At what my life will be.  And I can't handle it.
You don't trust me to be alone with them.	I trust you of course I do but $ 	But?  But what?
Oh my God.  Are you serious?	I think so# What do you think?	I think so too# 
It's forever you know.	Okay# Is that the good thing or the bad thing?	Because I can't hurt anyone like this ever again.
Out! Leave the table!	What?	You heard me: leave the table!
Hey.	Hey. What's up?	There's something I need to talk about with you.
Hey, you want to hear my short story now?	Huh?	I can read it to you.
What do you want?	Don't be so upset. It's OK# 	What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?
So? How was school today?	The same.	The same. Same as what?
Yeah, um, then# are you alone?	Uh huh.	Can I join you?
No, not really.	Any books you like to read for fun?	No.
Yeah# So you're um# you're married?	Yeah.	Huh. Kids?
Can I have a glass of water?	Certainly - how about some breakfast?	Possibly some coffee?
Then this is it.	What?	War.
So am I.	Listen, I think I'm hit bad.	Where'd they get you?
That was really great.	Was it okay?	Yeah!
Hey!	Hey. Do you have a cigarette?	No I quit.
Stuck with what guy?	What?	You said you didn't want to get stuck with some guy. What guy?
A long, long, long, long, while.	Okay, okay.	A long, long, long# 
Yeah.	Come on.	Play it! Come on!
What do you mean? His girlfriend?	Well, that's one way of putting it.	Am I fucking him?
Yeah. Yeah, it's okay for you. It's okay. Enjoy yourself.	Are you talking to me?	It's okay.
Yeah, we're all above that.	See, I wrote something about all this. Uh, it, it's a song about# 	Well, play it, man.
No, no, no, no, no, it's new.	Please.	I just started it.
You okay, man? You okay?	I didn't want to eat this much, man.	Wait, I'll get you some air.
Will you stand up for me?	Okay.	Come on. Inside.
Hi.	Hi.	So you, like, come from a town like this or# ?
Thinks he is. Well, he is.	He is?	Yes.
Can you tell me what happened?	He's drunk.	Uh-huh.
Oh, no, no, no. This is no big deal, you know? I can come down and, and get you out.	No, no. I'm not, I'm not talking about this. I did a bad thing, Jeff.	What? What'd you do?
You know, this, what you're doing with your life# 	I don't know.	You know, it's not you. You know? You seem like a smart guy.
No, wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! What is your name?	Look, why do you care, huh?	Because maybe if we know each other's names, things wouldn't get like this, My name's Jeff.
God, I haven't seen you all day.	You could've come over.	I know, I know, I know.
Was that supposed to be me?	No.	Yes.
Yes, you asshole.	About what?	About things that are important to me.
Come on.	No. No, no, no.	Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come.
I've run out of words.	Wait. What, what are you saying?	I don't know. And I don't care that I don't know.
So you think I should?	What?	Write. 'Cause I, I have written some things.
Well, I helped start it, but, you know, uh# 	Well, not exactly.	For a while.
I gotta take a piss. Do you mind if we pull over really quickly?	Oh, yeah.	I'm sorry. I, I gotta# 
I hope you're happy!	This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.	No, this has everything to do with you.
Soon.	Yep.	What's that supposed to mean?
I hate it here. It's so ugly, it's like being dead. You got out of here, you know? I'm ready to go.	Yeah, but sometimes I try to figure out why I left in the first place, you know? I think about people and I wonder what they're doing.	Yeah.
You know, man, it's none of your business what I do, okay?	It's none of my business?	Yeah.
I'm going out later.	No car.	The fuck not?
"No" you're not sure or "No" I'm not fat?	Uh, "no"#  You're not fat.	You sure I'm not fat?
You shouldn't smoke so many of those.	I know, but it keeps down the size of my can.	They could kill you.
Give me your coat.	Let it ride for a while.	You're going to stay, aren't you?
You forgot this.	Thanks.	I've been hoping to run into you.
Hello, Betty.	I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe.  Is it something awful?	Come on in, Betty,
Just a minute, you!	Yeah?	You're a writer, you said.
Are you or aren't you?	I think that's what it says on my driver's license.	And you have written pictures, haven't you?
What's that?	Just a scene I cut out.	What scene?
Now what is it?  Where's the fire?	I've lost my car.	Oh# and I thought it was a matter of life and death.
Suppose you listen just for a minute -	Madame is waiting.	For me?  Okay.
Some men are here.  They asked for you.	I'm not here.	That's what I told them.
I think I'd better keep it.	Whatever you say.	Yes. Whatever I say.  From now on.
What's happening?	I'm taking you to the hospital.	Let me out. I have to talk to you.
Don't leave me.	I have to.	When can I see, you again ?
There's one sure way to find out how you feel.	What's that?	Let me kiss you.
I don't love you any more.	Just like that?	Like turning off a light.
Away. From you.	But why?	Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.
Hi.	Hello. Are you still mad at me?	I'm not mad at you.
Before you go# 	What?	Just one kiss. For old times' sake.
You can't put her out of your mind, is that it?	Well# I guess I can't.	I'm ready for her. I'll show you.
Can I give you a lift?	Oh, no thanks.	It's no trouble. I'd like to ask you some more questions.
What's a tree?	It's something they have on Earth. You know, where your cousin went.	Where is Earth?
I have money to buy more, but I haven't had a chance since# 	Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something?	I'd rather not talk about it.
There is a way.	I knew it!	But it's impossible.
What's that? Never saw anything like that.	Don't stop. Keep moving.	Yes, mustn't stop.
He really was!	Uh-huh.	Well, aren't you excited?
I don't?	Of course not. Not when you've got so much going for you.	I do?
I'm in love with you. How do you feel?	We'd better talk.	I'm listening.
I'll try to remember that # 	Well, you should. Because I appreciate you, too, you know.	You do?
It has everything.	Wrong.	Why didn't you go before we left?
Oh #  no, there's no one back home.	What about here?	Well, my career takes up a lot of my time.
What now, my love?	Huh?	Big night coming up?
Can I take you to the airport?	Not unless you can fly.	Come again?
I'm telling you, I was there.	You were probably so scared you didn't look to see what the trick was.	It wasn't a trick!
Couldn't we forget the plane? You could lift me in your big strong arms?	Sure, and let the plane crash in the middle of the city.	Oh.
Oh. Why? does he live up here?	Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood.	What are you going to do to him?
Easy now, miss, I've got you???	You've got me? Who's got you???	Do as I say. Let go!
My name is# 	Mister, I don't want to know your name.	I understand.
Are you sure?	Yeah.	It just seems# kind of weird.
I used to like it here.  I used to care about what happened.  Now I think I'll sell my house and move the fuck away.	Billy, please.  The children.	The children.
Yes.	It's natural.	Your kids never cry.
You've talked to Billy?	I did.	And Billy told you that he'll tell that to# 
What do you think?	Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting.	You hate it.
So do you like your new room?	It's interesting.	Your Dad spent all his spare time in here.  He wanted to make it absolutely perfect.
Is this mine?	Yes.  It's a present.	From you?
Yes.	And where did you sit that morning?	My usual place.  On the right side. The first seat.
No.	Did there come a time when all the children had been picked up?	Yes.
That was great.	Really?	You're going to blow everyone away.
He's a lawyer.  He's our lawyer.	You and Mom have a lawyer?	Well, yes.  He's your lawyer too.
Yes.	How about Sunday night?  That's always the best time.	Okay.
Sidney is a liar!	Who said Sidney?	I said Sidney!# 
Uh huh.	When?	Tonight.  Before you go to bed. The cat is in the bag and the bag is in the river.
Sidney# I# I don't do this sort of thing# 	What sort of thing?	This sort of thing!
I swear, Sidney, I can't help it - sometimes I wonder what I see in you# 	That's no way to talk# 	Or what you see in me, for that matter# 
Swear.	What?	Just say "I swear I won't kill anyone."
I'll deal with the police.	Remember what I said, you can't# 	Trust me.
No!	I'm sorry, John.	No, no no!!  It'll be okay.  Stay with us!
Out of the way, John!	No!  Don't kill him!	It, John.  Not him.  It.
We're better off by ourselves.	But it's the only proof we have to the future#  about the war and all that.	I don't trust it!  These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know.  We may never have this opportunity again.
Mom?  You okay?	I couldn't#  oh, God.  You#  came here#  to stop me?	Uh huh.
It's okay.  It'll by okay.  We'll figure it out.	I love you, John.  I always have.	I know, Mom.  I know.
Okay, let's see. How long were you in the camp for?	Three months.	Says here because of your father. What's that mean?
I made no deal!	I don't buy that.	It's the truth.
If it's too hot, open your tie.	I wish to say something.	Go ahead, be my guest.
Do you know what that is?	Of course I know what that is.	Okay, so what is it?
We gotta get you to a doctor.	It's okay.  Forget it.	Forget it?  Are you crazy? Let me see it.
Sleep.  It'll be light soon.	Okay.  Talk some more.	About what?
That stuff's two hours cold.	I know.	I put a cigarette out in it.
Oh, God#  !	Don't just stand there, get help!	This can't be real# 
This is nuts.	What is your problem?	Ten minutes ago, I'm looking forward to a quiet dinner.  I get a note# 
See you around.	Where are you going?	Home.
There goes a thousand dollars.	Your shoes cost a thousand dollars?	That one did.
What are you doing here?	Can we talk?	It's okay, dad.
What is it?	Is this you?	Where'd you get this?
It's just money.  You should be glad you're alive.	It might be best if we didn't talk.	All I mean is#  someone like you# 
What the fuck are you#  ?	Where'd you get that gun?	It's mine# 
Don't move, you bitch#  !	I have to show you# 	No!
You look good.	So do you.  And to think I was worried# 	About me?
Tell me you'll call.	Okay.	Will you?
I thought you'd like this.  Best thing I ever did.  If you don't want to do it, DON'T# 	I'll call them, okay?	It doesn't matter# 
No!  You're one of them.  Of course, it makes perfect sense!	No, it doesn't!  Those keys were put there.  I didn't even know# 	You're behind this, aren't you?  You and your sick friends.  Well, make it stop!
Really?	Yeah.	Split it?
I've been so lonely.	I can't tell you how not interested I am.	Don't be nervous.  They said you'd be nervous.
Pleasure to meet you, I'd like to see my brother, thank you.	Your brother.  Will you come with me?	What's this about?
What the fuck#  ?!	Why are you following me?	I don't know what you're talking about.  I'm just driving# 
Luke, can I talk to you?	Sure.	Because#  well, I know I can trust you.
Let's say it wasn't you.  Who did it?	I don't know.	It was a stupid thing to do.
Someone is playing with you.	Why?	I don't know.
What do you want?	Oh!  You scared me.	Me?  No.  What are you doing here?
Why?	Why'd she kill herself?	Yes.
You've been out of the world for a long time, haven't you?	Yes.  I've missed it.	No.  The world has missed you.
Are you sure?	I think so.	Okay.
We think someone is here.	We think?	We can't find #   #  two of our guys.
No.	Why not?	Because $ 
How they goin', kid?	Not bad.	How'd you like to kill someone for me?
Same as last time $  the rest after.	Where do we go?	When you find the guy, you'll know.
Where do you think he is, Mike.	We'll find him.	No.  I mean.  Not even your people should be involved.  Right?  It's too close now.
You broke last time.	Let him break - he likes to break.	Fuck you.
I didn't expect anyone.	No reason.	I mean, what has it been $  six months?
Why didn't you just kill him, you had the chance.	That would be too easy.	Too easy?
I've been wondering something.	Again?	Do you have any friends, man?
What d'you say, Elaine?	Not much $  you?	Same.
Why did you come here?	Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?	No, why did you come here?
Sort a few things out.	Been busy, have you.	How d'you mean?
How much.	Five thousand.	Hey.
She's nice lookin'.	So what.	I dunno.  I just said she's nice lookin'.
How'd you get in here.	Walked.	You walked.  What the hell are you doing here.
What.	Tell me.	Tell you # 
# Was that a pass?	Maybe.	You're out of line, mister.
# You bring a check?	Cash.	Cash?!
Please, Ed.	But it's# 	Please, Ed.
# My books used to be perfect. Anyone could open them up, make sense of the whole goddamn store.	Honey# 	I knew we'd pay for it.
Will anyone else say they knew?	I don't know. I don't think so.	How did you get into the store?
Thanks. Thanks for seeing me, at home.	Oh, hell. Drink?	No thanks.
Coffee, Ed?	I'm fine. Thanks.	No thanks, honey.
# Huh?	Haven't I seen you up in ladies' wear?	I don't work here. My wife does.
Frank.	Huh?	This hair.
Yes, sir.	Could you come with me please?	Sure. Can Ed come too?
The body?	What's left of it.	Mind if I have a look?
Lieutenant!  It's me.	What is it?	Dr. Green has to see you!
You work here?	Yes, I do.	What do you do?
Quiet!	What is it?	I don't know.  But I think it's bad.
We have to try and draw it off!	How?	The answer's right in front of us.
How can they have a child?	It's not gonna be his, you idiot.	Why not?
It's okay.  I probably wouldn't talk to me either.	I'm sorry.  It's not up to me.	You have a boyfriend?  Of course you do.
I was hoping we could have a special evening.	I won't be late.	Did something happen today?
Where have you been?	I've been thinking$ 	Oh, God.
I have to talk with you.  But not here.  Let's go for a walk.	I'm sorry, I'm late.	What's the hurry?
They're coming.  Any minute.	Who?	They're going to stop me talking to you.
Those people were already dead.	Before the bomb went off?	That's what I'm saying.
Had you.	No you didn't.	Oh yeah. Had you big time.
I wake you?	No.	Why not? It's three AM.
What happened?	What difference does it make# ?	Tell me.
Thank you.	No problem.	No.  Thank you.
I need it.	Now?	Now.
You sure you want to go through with this?	What else do we do?!	I don't know, Pete, but for god's sake#  This is nuts.  Do you really understand what they're going to do?
No.	He has a little dog.	Oh, yes, yes.
Oh, that was many years ago.	Tell me more.	Oh, it's very difficult. You know Harry# we didn't do# 
Seemed like a good idea.	It's just what he used to say.	Well, I didn't learn that from him.
Let's go away.	What's the matter?	Let's not get into any more trouble.
I said another man was buried in his place.	Where's Harry?	That's what we want to find out.
# to him.	What are you trying to say?	He was# 
Wait a minute - let me out.	Well, there's not much time.	One can't just leave - please.
# his number.	I'll look it up for you.	Well, look, is there a car here I can use?
Hello, Harry.	Well, well, they seem to've been giving you quite some busy time.	Listen# 
Hmm.	She's been arrested.	Tough# tough# Don't worry, old man, they won't hurt her.
What do you want me to do?	You can get somebody else# 	Do you expect me to give myself up?
I thought there was something funny about the whole thing.	Funny?	Something wrong.
Everyone ok?	We're ok.	I think we're about half way.
Have you told someone?	No.	I think it's a bad idea to tell anyone.
Do we have to listen to this shit?	Yes.	Why'd we have to leave so fast?
What do you care?	I don't, but# 	Let's look at the fucking thing.
Yeah, but not on the letters.	Why the fuck not?	Just don't.
You write that?  Come work for me. You've got a lot to learn; I can teach it to you.	I have a job.	This? This is a joke.  I'll give your group a thousand bucks.
Oh, what is this shit?	Keep driving. Don't slow down.	Christ# 
You missed on purpose.	I didn't. I told you, I can't $ 	What's that?
SO THEY SHOT HIM! SO HE WAS DEAD. SO WHAT. HE'S WORSE THAN DEAD NOW. HE'S A PIECE OF SHIT# 	Okay, that's it. You're going back to $ 	What do you think you should have done?
Are you going to keep it?	Yes.	Does he know?
I tell you she's mine!	Hello!	You know each other?
Huh?  Well listen to him!  Do you hear that?	No.	He looks me in the eye like some fuckin' gold fish, and says:  "I'm going to beat you".
Well, good night, then# 	You going to sleep here, all by yourself?	Yes# 
You risk your life when you cross the street.	Damn it!  Why won't you give me a straight answer, for once?!	Because you'd laugh.
#  Not yet.	Don't.	Why?
You don't mind if I go instead, do you?	No# 	If you did mind, you'd tell me, wouldn't you?
No, no!	Not at all!	You're staying at the hotel?
Today at lunch, you asked me if I had any questions.	Ah ha.  You finally want to know about women.	Why?  Are they what's most important?
You were right.	#  I was right about what?	#  It is much better down there. It's a better place.
I recognize you.	We saw each other a little while ago.	In the lake?
Thanks for helping with the bag.  It looks great!	I thought it was a nice place.  Isn't it?	I'm being a pain in the ass.  It's beautiful here.
She's not like the others.  She can't stand to be away from the sea.	How do you know that?	I don't know, I just feel it.
So have I.  #  Hello?	I'm still here.	Well, then, talk to me some more.
I'm being a pain, huh?	#  Not at all.	You sure?
Promise me one thing.	Anything.	Promise you won't forget me.
Good.  That way I'll see more of you#  Where are you going to stay?	Well#  here.	In my apartment?
Well?	What?	How was your trip?
What!?	I said, yeah, about once a week!	Oh!
This is for "mama and the kids."	What about me?	You get your money from your husband.
What did they say before the bad card came up?	You'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.	You and your cards. Meet a rich man! I look for them with money. What rich man hasn't money. And for what was I born if it wasn't for money? You're not telling me anything.
Come to look around?	More or less.	I'll take you about. Got some nice things.
I will of course do my best to hang onto it.	Where is it?  He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?	I can tell you that yet. But he being well looked after.
Do you think we let him get away with the murder of my brother?	We? You and your parents killed your husband?	No. Not us# 
Ever seen him before?	No#  No#   I swear# 	What this place? A hotel of some kind?
What did they say?	Uh#  they said#  they will think about it.	Good.
If you really want to help me, there's one thing you can do.	Tell me# 	Tell the king to give me more men.
I am ready now# 	Just give me a moment and then you'll be free# 	I'm already free# 
Are you alright?  Did they hurt you?	No no, I'm fine, really# 	I was so worried $  we've all been looking for you!  The English are everywhere!  O thank you, lord!
Quick $  hide in here# 	What about you?	Don't worry about me $  just stay in here#  and don't move!
Well# ?  Shall we go?	Not yet.	The English won't wait.
Stop it!  What are you doing?	Nothing#  just taking his teeth.	But you can't just kill a man for his teeth!
What are you doing out here?	I might ask you the same question.	I#  I'm leaving#  I can't take anymore# 
They won't come anyway.	What do you mean, they won't come?	Why would they?
You think you are ready now?	Yes, my lord.	Let's see.
So#  everything sounds#  wonderful?	Yes, it is.	Then#  why are you here so often?
I heard about your sister, and I#  understand your pain# 	Why did she have to die?	Only God knows the answer to that.
It's not going to be very comfortable.	I'll be fine.	You'll have to stay here until tomorrow afternoon.
Must feel better this side of the wall.	Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.	Here.
What's happened?	Oh my God, it's terrible, you've got to do something, oh my God!	Calm down, what, what is it?
It's not funny.	Well, you know what's funny? You're funny with that ridiculous tie.	What are you talking about, my tie? What's my tie got to do with anything? I need the tie for my work.
I tried your friends. They're not at that address any more.  But.	You made contact?	Be ready to leave in two days' time. Same place as last night.
She wants to see what you can do.	I'd rather not play. I want to listen and learn that way.	Everyone has to practice.
Give it to me!  Please.  I gotta know it's all there!	You just sit tight, old man.  We're gonna have to get you to a doctor.  I'll call a cop.	No, no cops!
You think he'll show?	Did he say he wouldn't?	No.
You got a back door to this place?	No.  What's wrong with the front?	Look, I don't have time to fuck around.  There's somebody out there I don't need to see.  You got a fire escape or anything?
I, ah# thought you might wanna come out for a while.  Maybe have a drink or somethin'.	You move right along, don't ya.	I don't mean nothin' by it.  I just don't know many regular girls, that's all.
You should always look to the back too, kid.	I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.	Get on with it then.
Well, what did I tell ya?	You're a lucky man, all right.	Lucky, hell.  I could do it every day.
What happened?	I didn't get the bet down in time.	Oh, Jesus.
What's your next step, Nick?	Right back to California.  We've got to go home and rest up from our vacation.	We'll see you before you go.
What?	Nothing.	You better take a drink.
How are you?	Another young man.	It's the same one.
Well!	That is, if it's all right with you.	And if it isn't?
Oh, Andy.	Don't cry.	I can't help it.  You don't know# ..
This is a pretty dead bunch, isn't it?	You're high enough.	Why not?
That isn't true.  It was about your father.  Where is he?	He's all right.  Isn't that enough?	No.
Is your father still in there?	He's waiting for you.	Did he tell you where he was going?
You know, we know each other.	Of course we do! We've been friends for years.	Aren't you Nick Charles?
Wait a minute.  When is it going to be? I'm leaving town tonight.	Where are you going?	It's a secret.  I can't even tell you, my dear.  I've got an important idea to work on.
Poor Dad, does that still bother you?	Only in bad weather.	But it isn't bad weather now.
This gun yours?	No.	Who's is it?
Well, what'd you think?	I think we're on the right track.	Who're you calling?
Are you kidding?	No.	Why didn't you tell me? # . Why didn't you hold him?
I said he hadn't written me.	Oh, then you did hear from him?	Well# .
That's all right.  Well, we'll be going.	Goodbye.	Goodbye.
What are you going to do?	Just what I said I'd do.	You wouldn't do that#   you wouldn't!
and there she was lying dead.  The police said she'd probably been killed about ten minutes before I got there.	I thought you said you weren't going there.	Why, you said# 
Who's that man?	He's not anybody.  Just a fellow I used to know.	I thought you'd given up that sort of friend.
Did you get my money?	I do wish you'd tell me where you're going.	I'm not telling anyone.
One hundred#   two hundred#  three# 	Never mind.	I wish you'd count them.  There's a thousand dollars there.
Thanks, and goodbye.	What'll I do if something comes up?	Settle it yourself.  What have I got a lawyer for?
How are you?	I hate to bother you when you're laid up.	That's all right.
I tell you $  he didn't do it.	They'll want more than your word for that.	All right, then $  I'll tell them who did do it!
You did#  where?	Last night.  He came to see me at my apartment.	Oh, did he?  What did he say?
I'd better order some food.  That sounds like an interesting case.  Wouldn't you like to take it?	I haven't the time.  I'm much too busy seeing that you don't lose any of the money I married you for.	Room service, please -
Where did you get that?	She brought it in.  Trying to make me believe she did it.	What are you going to do with it?
Nick!  Nick!  Are you asleep?	Yes.	Good. I want to talk to you.
Everybody says you were a grand detective.	They were kidding you.	I'd like to see you work.
But it's Christmas now.	Breakfast.	What are you going to give me?  I hope I don't like it.
You're a fine watch dog.	He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.	On it!  I'm in it #  They think I did it!
I never saw that before.	No.  It's a Christmas present.	Who gave it to you?
Well, that's that.  Stay there, Nick!	It's not going to hurt me to get up.	Sit down!
I'm going to tell her.	Hey#  hey.  Don't do that.	But the poor kid's going crazy. She'd rather know her father was dead than that# 
I can't wait any longer.  Tell me, do you think one of them did it?	Yes.	I wish you'd tell me who.
Is that true?	I don't know.	Why are you saying it?
Nick Charles here?	Yes.  Nick!	You his wife?
I'm sorry#   but# 	Two weeks work gone for nothing.	I just wanted to tell you# 
Where are you going?	Home!	Home?
I don't want to see people killed any more than you.  But we try to help out we die, and all we do is die.	We can't just go off and$ 	There's nothing we can do.  We shouldn't even be here in the first place.
It'll be too dark to make our way back now.  Let's bed down for the night and head out at first light.	What about the gold?	What about it?
Says he wanted food.  Liar.  He wanted the gold.	How's he going to want the gold?  He couldn't even know we had it.	He# he could have been watching us.
Just keep quiet.	I have to answer him.	So you can give us away?
She okay?	Yeah.  Yeah, she's fine.	Let's go.
What?	I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing.  I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.	You can't tell anybody about this.
Hey# hey!  Slow up.  You don't have to go so fast.	Faster we get there, faster we get back.	Yeah.  I know.  I'm with you.
Oh, God!  Oh God!	Just be cool.	It's a mine, isn't it?
My leg is falling asleep.	It's not falling asleep.  You've only been standing there for three minutes.	I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.
Where is it?  Where'd it go?	Stay low.	Where the hell is it!?
What are we going to do?  What the hell are we going to do?	We're not going to do anything.	They're going to kill us!
What are you doing?	What does it look like I'm doing?	It looks like you're not doing anything.
What?	We send the gold up what's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here?	He's not going to leave us.
What are we going to do?  How are we going to find our way back!?	We'll find our way.	How!?
No.	What do you mean no?  They can fly us home.	They'll ask questions; want to know why we were out here.
I'm glad I didn't have to kill you.  I'm glad it didn't come to that.	Yeah.  Well, me too.	I never killed anybody before.  I talk a good game, but I'm not like that.
Don't go bitch on me now!  You were going to kill me.  Kill them!	I just said I would.  I don't think I$ 	Shoot them!
Well?	A car's got to come along sooner or later.  When it does, we jack it.	How do we do that?
You get it yet?	Naw, nothing.	You will.  You'll get it.
I thought we were dead.	Yeah, well, we're not.	We got to get out of here.
You down?	Yeah, we're down.	What do you see?
Maybe we should give him some water.	All last night he could have been$ 	I think he wants something to drink.
What's this?  Why did you change it?	You've seen enough.	You know I don't feel well.
Look, food!	That's not food.  Can't be food.	Looks like food.
What time is it?	What?	I said what time is it?  How long was I out?
They know.  They've been watching us.  I can feel it.	They don't know.	They're watching us now.
What are you doing here?	I was lost.	# and you're not lost now?
I'm sorry.	What do you want?	Save yourself# .
Good, now the other side.	Nothing.	Okay, let's go in.
What do you think?	Call upstairs, see what you can find out.	Right.
No#  No more killing.	Stay here.	Alex, please.
Mike# 	Don't talk.	Take your time#  one day at a time, kid# 
And do you know what I'd like to have you do with that check?	What?	Make it out to cash!
Your bag?	Yes, my bag!	Didn't you take it with you?
Take my hand. I'll pull you back in.	No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.	No you won't.
Hello again.	Could I speak to you in private?	Uh, yes. Of course. After you.
You have to go for help.	I'll be right back.	I'll wait here.
Will you please excuse me? I'll be right back.	We'll save you a place at our table.	Thanks.

Paris -	Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!	Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?
#  Do you have a gun?	What?	You heard me. A gun?  I left mine in the car.
We can't really bring another family in here with us.	Why not? Harry says that's the only way to do good.	When did you talk to Harry?

Alan!	Where did you hear that name?	Well, isn't it $  ?
I'm done.	Where are you off to young lady?	I have a book report.
I should have gone to the police, I suppose.	But you didn't.  Why not?	I don't know.  I guess#  I wanted to see what would happen.
Yes.	Yes what?	Uh, yes, it is important.
Hi, honey.  How was the flight?	Fine, honey.  Stay asleep.	Okay.
I was in the area, and I thought you might like to have lunch.	They must've just missed me.	They said you had to run out.
What?	Do you still love your husband?	Yes.
Harry, what's the matter with you?  Tell them the truth.  We're married, we have a daughter$ 	I don't know what this crazy bitch is on.  You should just cut her loose, so we can get down to business.	Oh yeah?  Oh yeah?  Then where did I get this?
Are you sure you weren't followed?	I kept looking back, like you taught me.  I didn't see anyone.	Okay.  It's just, things are a bit hot for me right now.  If I get a signal#   I may have to leave suddenly.

Like it?	Very much. Now, where were we?	What kinda music do you like?
Was it him or you?	Yeah. But to be honest, I put myself in that position. When I drove up there I said to myself, "If I can kill 'em and get away with it, I'll do it." I could. So I did.	Is this a joke?
I think what you did was# 	What?	I think what you did# 
What?	Can you live with it?	Live with what?
Where the fuck is that bitch?	She's with me.	Who the fuck are you?
Well, there's a story behind all that. I'll tell you when I see you. By the way, I won't be alone. I'm bringing my wife with me.	Get the fuck outta here!	I'm a married man.

You used to call me "James".	You'd prefer that? #  James# you don't really have a gun, do you.	Everybody's got a gun.  In this city# 
You were in my dream just now.  Your hair was different, but I'm sure it was you.	We dream about what's important in our lives. And I seem to have become pretty important in yours.  What was the dream about?	About an airport# before everything happened.  It's the same dream I always have $  the only one.  I'm a little kid in it.
I told you what I want.  Lock the door!	James, why don't we# ?	Lock it now!
We need gas.	I thought you didn't know how to drive.	I said I was too young to drive.  I didn't say I was stupid.
You were going to run out off gas on purpose, weren't you?	No.  I want you to turn yourself in, James $  It'll go much better for you if you do $  but I'm not going to trick you.	That has your name on it.  Give him cash.
I don't have time to go upstairs.  The police are looking for me.  I need to know where it is and exactly what it is.	I get it!  This is your old plan, right?	Plan?  What are you talking about?
Hey!  You there!	You want something, old man?	Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.	Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.	That a fact?

How far is it to California?	From here?  I don't know.  Far.  Far enough.	Have you ever been there before?
John?  John where are you going?	I think this heat is making me crazy.  I was crazy to come back here, I'm crazy for listening to anyone in this town, and I'd sure as hell be crazy if I spent another minute in this place.	John, please$ 
Shit!	It's not like he's a young man. He's had time to live.	Jesus Christ!  Listen to yourself! I can't do it, Grace.  I can't do it.
I thought you would be on your way to Vegas by now.  Is there something you wanted?	I wanted to talk.	I don't think we have anything to talk about.
Where's the safe?	I don't know.	You don't know?  Jesus Christ! Don't you think you should have found out before we killed him?
Nothing.  There's no safe under here.	There has to be!	There isn't!  There's nothing under here but more floor.  Jesus fucking Christ!  We killed a man for nothing but floor.
Let's do it here.	What about him?	Let him watch.  I want him to know what he's missing.
That's all talk.  He's got nothing on us.  He let you kill Jake.	Not me.  Us.	It doesn't matter.  He was there and he let it happen.  He can't take us in.
I shot him.	You killed him!	He was going to take the money.
Jesus, Grace.  Did you have to kill him?	He was going to$ 	I know.  He was to take the fucking money.
John!  Can you hear me?  Are you still there?	Where the hell am I going to go?	John, you have to throw the keys up to me.

I went to your place.  We talked, just like you told me.  We drove out into the desert # 	Is the job done?	No.
Yeah, well, me too.	Trouble with the car again?	You could say.  I don't even have it yet.
Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.	You expect me to believe that?	I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
Now, what's this?	Give it to me!	Mexico?  You're going to Mexico?
Why don't you step out of the car, son?	I don't understand what the$ 	Just step from the car.  Nice and slow.
Hey!  You there!	You want something, old man?	Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.	Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.	That a fact?
I wasn't doing anything.	That's not the way it looked to me.  Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.	Make time?  Is everybody in this town on drugs?
Then maybe you should've. Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.	You expect me to believe that?	I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
Now, what's this?	Give it to me!	Mexico?  You going to Mexico?

What you want?	Open up!	We're closed.  Come back when the sun comes up.
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?	I'm just going to my car?	That's right on my way.
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.	You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?	I like that about me, beautiful.
No, I've got it.	What happened to your hand?	Accident.

Ted, have you lost your mind?	You like me. I like you. I guess it's pretty obvious to everyone.	I don't LIKE you. We're JUST FRIENDS.
You guys are my parents.	Of course we are.	They didn't want me when I was born. Why should I care# 
I can't believe your dad built this for you.	He didn't. He had it built.	Whatever.
That's probably my office.	Well? Where the hell are you?	He's on the move?
You do like girls, don't you?	Of course I like girls.	A lot? I mean, a whole lot?
Truth is, I'm a little nervous.	YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous?	All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure.
How are you, Kelly? Would you like to take a break for a minute?	I just want to get it over with.  My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it.	I know you do.
Guess I kind of lost it there.	You could say that.	Were you ever in a situation where you could see a thing coming and you didn't do what you could to stop it?
About a year ago.	He dropped Jimmy off first?	Yeah.
He did say something.	What was that?	He said, "No little bitch can ever make me come."
I can't believe you called Sam.  What's the matter with you?	I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared there's no one to trust.	You can trust me.
You're gonna fuck me over, aren't you?	Oh, for Christ's sake.	You are.

Well?	They're coming.	When are they coming?
I can't.	Why not?	Why not?
Why did you say that?	Say what?	I love you.
What's that?  I hear something!	You hear trouble.	What is it?
Kill him!	No!	Kill him!
You must learn magic.	That's all I ever wanted!	Then I will teach you.
Hey, Sam# 	# I want to say a thing.	What's that, Sam?
Where are you taking us?	We're looking for a suspect. We've reason to believe he's still in the area.	You have no right to keep us here.
Where are you taking us now?	Home.	You couldn't wait until morning?
But John#  why didn't you go to a hospital?	No, no doctor# 	But why?
Anybody know about this?	I didn't even know about it.	Okay, Sam. Can you tell me what he looked like?
It's me.	Johnny! Where the hell have you been?	Never mind. I'm coming in to take care of business. How hot am I?
You hear me?	I hear you. I'll stay in touch.	That's more like it.  Where are you at, anyway?
You know where he is.	Wrong.	You'd lie to protect him.
You admit you're lying?	I admit I don't know where he is.	You're the first one he'll contact.
Is the English dead?	No# 	Looks dead# 
I am not a child.	You are acting like one!	I will be the judge of that.
Get back in there.	My son is out there!	Nobody's going to hurt your son# 
But I did leave you, Uncle Henry $  that's just the trouble.  And I tried to get back for days and days.	There, there, lie quiet now.  You just had a bad dream.	No $

Now you're seeing reason.	No $ 	Here's what I'm taking him in $  so he can't attack me again.
I'd be too scared to ask him for it.	Oh, well, then $  we'll ask him for you.	I'd sooner wait outside.
Down?  No, you see, I'm $  Well, $  I'm $ 	Oh, well, here $  let me help you.	Oh, that's very kind of you $  very kind.

His what?	His #  whatever.	I'm not his #  whatever.  Okay?
Just about anything I want, it looks like. This is gonna be tough, though. There's no way to save this game. I gotta get it right the first time through.	What do you get if you finish?	Nothing, really. My guy is just doing it to stay alive.
Are you alright?	What the hell are you doing? You could've killed me!	I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.
I was thinking maybe you and me could go into town.	Were you now?	What do you say?
Don't you knock?	They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?	Actually I'm feeling up to leaving.
Is that what you're looking for?	A piece.  Only a piece.	Is it enough?
Darling!	Hello# ?	Surprised?
Surprised?	Surprised!	Love me?
How long will this whole thing take?	A week.  Ten days at most.	I'll have to think it over.  It's not so easy just to pick up and# 
But what you were doing?	Just putting up some tea.	Did you hear that strange music?
It seems that way.  You didn't hear any music at all?	What?	You didn't hear#  nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?
It's not enough.  More!  More, do you hear me?	What?	More, do you hear me?
How's it going?	What did you find out?	Someone was playing this in the music room.
Come on, big fellow!	Is everything ready?	Yes, master.  Are you sure you want to go through with it?
Are you busy?	That's quite all right.  What is it, dear?	Could I lie down in your bed for a little while?  I just can't sleep.
Do you think you can sing it?	Me?  Sing?	Yes $  quickly, dear!
Did you do it?	I think so.	Good!  It shouldn't take more than a few seconds.
Yes# yes, you have yours.	Why don't we talk inside?	Well#   #  perhaps for a few minutes.
Yes, I know.	It wouldn't be fair to her.	Yes, I know.
How long is it so far?	Four	Three minutes to go!
Do you think she might be interested in  someone?	Which one?	Well that one. The one who keeps looking at me.
